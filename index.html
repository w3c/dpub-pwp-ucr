        Publications, from corporate memos to newsletters to electronic books to scholarly journal articles, must be considered first-class content on the Web, equal to the more common forms of Web pages available today.
        This document describes the various use cases highlighting the problems users and publishers face when these publications are to be used in a digital, Web environment.
        The requirements that come from those use cases provide the basis for the technical considerations in a companion document, currently entitled “Web Publications”&nbsp;[[wpub]]</a>.

            This is work in progress. The final version of this document is planned to be published as a
            Working Group Note.
         </p>

         <p>
            A previous version of this document was published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a> as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-pwp-ucr-20170502/">Interest Group Note</a>. 
            After the closure of that Interest Group the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Publishing Working Group</a> took it over for further work.

    <section id="introduction">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely
          joined by hyperlinks. Clustering within domains and with explicit
          navigation elements built into them, webpages evolved into websites.
          This model inherited very little from an existing, powerful
          and much older page-based media: books.</p>

        <p>Over centuries, “books” have assumed many forms: journals, magazines,
          pamphlets of long-form articles and essays, newspapers, atlases, comics,
          notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different
          manifestations as “publications”: bound editions of meaningful media,
          made public.</p>

        <p>Another form of publication that also has a long history in both the
          printed as well as the digital world are documents. These are
          publications that are written and distributed in a more ad-hoc manner,
          such as legal briefs, corporate memos, and even the definitions of
          standards, such as this content currently being read.</p>

        <p>We believe there is great value in combining this older tradition
          of portable, bounded publications with the pervasive accessibility,
          addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform (OWP). New
          models of economic sustainability and innovative experiences of knowledge
          depend on this.</p>

        <p>It is the task of the W3C
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a> to
          explore the uniqueness, desirability, and feasibility of bringing
          these two great models of publishing together. This document explores
          requirements based on examples of real world use cases and scenarios. Requirements
          for publications on the Web are explored first, without referring
          to any packaging aspect that would correspond to current practices like EPUB. This is
          followed by requirements of those packaging aspects, as a structure on top of a
          purely Web based distribution.
          The complete list of requirements is also collected in a separate table in
          <a href="#req_list"></a>.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Terminology</h2>
          <ul class="terms">
              <li>This document uses the term <dfn>user agent</dfn>, as used by the Web
              community; see, for example, the <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Definition_of_User_Agent">WAI
              glossary entry</a>. The publishing community often uses the term
              “reading system” for roughly the same notion; while there may be
              subtle differences, it is better to stick
              to a single term for the purposes of this document.</li>

			  <li>A <dfn>Web Publication</dfn> (WP) is a collection of one or more constituent resources,
			  organized together in a uniquely identifiable grouping, and presented using
			  standard Open Web Platform technologies.</li>

              <li>A <dfn>Packaged Web Publication</dfn> (PWP) is a <a>Web Publication</a> whose
              constituent resources are combined into a single distributable file, using some standard
              packaging format.</li>

              <li>In this document, <dfn>manifest</dfn> refers to an abstract means to contain information necessary to the proper management, rendering, and so on, of a publication. This is opposed to metadata that contains information on the content of the publication like author, publication date, and so on.
              The precise format of how such a manifest is stored is not considered in this document.</li>

        <h1>Web Publications</h1>
        <p>This section describes the use cases specific to <a data-lt="Web Publication">Web Publications</a> and the Open Web Platform, including associated publishing needs, and discoverability.</p>

        <section id='pwp-readers'>
            <h2>Readers’ Needs</h2>
            <section id='pwp-owp'>
                <h2>Open Web Platform</h2>
                <p class="req-set" id="r_owp">Web Publications should be able to make use of all
                features offered by the OWP.</p>

                <p>There is a remarkable development of tools and frameworks built
                on top of OWP that make it possible to develop powerful interactive
                layers on top of OWP. These include, for example, data visualization
                systems (e.g., d3, built on top of SVG), possibilities to access
                external services like Wolfram Alpha, or tools to create and store (possibly as part of the publication) annotations. These tools have been
                traditionally developed around browsers, and provide possibilities that
                 publications should also benefit from. That requires that <a data-lt="Web Publication">Web Publications</a> become first class citizens on the Web platform.</p>

                <ul class="use-cases">
                    <li>A large, multidisciplinary, Web-based journal relies on
                    traditional Web technologies like HTML and CSS for its
                    content. The journal, responding to the evolving
                    expectations of its audience, is increasingly using
                    additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics,
                    and very large images; the trend is to consider these as
                    integral parts of the scientific output. The journal as a
                    result needs access to the latest visualization and other
                    data management tools that the OWP-based tools can
                    offer.</li>

                    <li>Educational publications are increasingly making use of OWP
                    features. They include interactive exams (possibly linked to
                    online evaluation facilities), visualization of data or of
                    algorithms, built-in interpreters for various languages (e.g.,
                    for courses on programming); in many respects, the borderline
                    between these publications and Web applications is becoming
                    fuzzy.</li>

                    <li id="in_house_doc">BigBoxCo, a large technology company
                    with extensive “in-house” documentation to support the
                    technical and/or user documentation for their various
                    products and administrative processes, develops all this
                    material in digital-only formats. The quantity of
                    documentation makes it impractical to produce these documents
                    in print. Instead, the company publishes them
                    on the company intranet, and/or provides them to their
                    employees and contractors via specialized mobile applications.
                    These documents, as a type of publication, require
                    accessibility, portability of annotations, and
                    the possible inclusion of complex media.</li>

                <h3>Horizontal Dependencies</h3>
                <p class="req-set" id="r_horizdep">A Web Publication should conform to the requirements of all horizontal dependencies.</p>

                <p>Web content has to be consumed under different
                circumstances: it must be available to the largest
                possible audience in a secure manner, providing the
                necessary protection of the reader’s privacy. Publication
                content must be able to answer to a number of principles
                like accessibility, internationalization, device
                independence, security, and privacy. (These are usually
                referred to, in the W3C context, as “horizontal”
                dependencies.) These principles are, in general terms:
                </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Accessibility:</dt>
                    <dd>People with disabilities should be able to access
                      the content of a publication. They should be able to perceive,
                      understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well
                      as contribute to it. Accessibility encompasses all
                      disabilities that affect access to the content,
                      including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive,
                      and neurological disabilities.</dd>

                    <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
                    <dd>Publications should be well adapted to any language,
                      writing systems, region, or culture. This includes the
                      usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left,
                      horizontal or vertical writing; item numbering, or
                      interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of
                      the right character sets and of local typographic conventions.</dd>

                    <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
                    <dd>The content in a publication should be usable on a large number of devices
                      with very different device characteristics: different
                      screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying
                      level of processing power, etc. These different affordances
                      should be automatic with no, or very little, user intervention.</dd>

                    <dt>Security:</dt>
                    <dd>Publications should be presented by a User Agent using a security model that is at least (if not more) secure than the standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/runtime/">Web security model</a>. Doing this will prevent publications that contain malicious attacks,
                    data theft, and other security incidents from impacting users by jeopardizing the integrity of the underlying data or machine operations.</dd>

                    <dt>Privacy:</dt>
                    <dd>The content in a publication should maintain and support user privacy,
                      in spite of the fact that the evolution of online
                      technologies has increased the possibility for the
                      collection and processing of personal, and possibly
                      sensitive, data. However, since a publication may use <a href="#pwp-owp">any part of the OWP</a>, it may choose to use  functionality such as the ability to
                      track a user's activity within the publication.</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>These principles correspond to technical requirements on
                  the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its possible
                  extension to Web Publications) insofar as the technologies must
                  empower the authors (writers, editors, publishers,
                  etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether
                  authors use the possibilities of these technologies or
                  not is not addressed in this document.</p>

                <p>All these constraints are formalized in the
                  context of the usage on the Web and by extension Web Publications.
                  This means that they are valid
                  for publications in general.
                  In some cases, for example due to legislative reasons,
                  the demands on publications may be more stringent
                  than for generic Web sites. The use cases below provide
                  some examples for the publication-specific situations. Note also that
                  some aspect of horizontal dependencies (e.g., accessibility or security), are
                  also the subject of further use cases and requirements elsewhere in this document.
                </p>

                <ul class="use-cases">

                    <li id="req-set_1">(On Accessibility) Legal Publishing Ltd.
                      publishes all the official texts as issued by the
                      government of its country. Per local legislation, the
                      publication must be accessible, following W3C’s WCAG
                      Level AA requirements, to serve as official references
                      in courts.</li>

                    <li id="req-set_2">(On Privacy, Accessibility) EducationPublishing
                      Ltd. publishes digital textbooks to cover BigUniversity’s
                      curriculae. These (digital) educational publications also
                      include access to interactive tests via specialized
                      services on the Web that regularly access the student’s
                      progress. The privacy and the integrity of the student’s
                      test data must be preserved. This, and the fact that
                      digital textbooks must also abide to WCAG Level AA
                      requirement in terms of accessibility, are such that
                      EducationPublishing may be liable in case they are not

                      SA. publishes literary work all over the world and in
                      many languages. In order to continue its business in Japan,
                      it must be able to produce digital publications
                      with right-to-left and vertical writing, and following
                      the Japanese typesetting traditions, because that is
                      the only way those publications are accepted by local
                      customers.</li>

                    <li>(On Privacy) Thomas has written a pamphlet advocating a government
                      overthrow. The government has decreed that the author of the pamphlet
                      as well as its readers of the pamphlet shall be jailed. Thomas needs
                      to distribute the pamphlet in ways that preserve his anonymity and
                      allow the public to read without fear of the government cyber-police.</li>

                      tablet when he is at home, but he does not carry his tablet
                      around while commuting on the train. Instead, he prefers to use
                      his phone to continue reading. Publications must be able to
                      adapt to the consumption environment, so as to provide a good
                      reading experience regardless of the device.</li>

              <h3>Information on Constituent Resources</h3>

              <p class="req-set" id="r_con-res">The information regarding the
                constituent resources of a Web Publication must be easily discovered
                and there should be a way to differentiate between essential and
                non-essential resources.</p>

              <p>A Web Publication will likely be composed of multiple Web documents and their
                resources. A more complicated Web Publication may have many resources, some of
                which are essential and some of which are not. Because of this
                complexity, extracting in advance all the references to some or all
                constituent resources may be prohibitive. It is therefore necessary
                for the user agent to have an easy access to the list of constituent
                resources and some of their characteristics such as whether they are
                essential, their media types, or their sizes. </p>

             <p>In a publication, some content is essential to the user being
                able to consume it while other content could be either absent or
                have a provided fallback for situations such as limited connectivity
                or storage. This information, provided by the author or publisher of
                the Web Publication, would enable a user agent to provide a better
                experience to the user. For example, the user agent can ensure that
                essential resources are made available when offline (see <a
                href="#onloffl"></a>).</p>

             <ul class="use-cases">
                <li>Nick is reading a long-form narrative on a device with limited storage: a publication
                  filled with text, images, sounds, and multimedia files.
                  Nick also rides the subway, where
                  he loses Internet connectivity frequently and without
                  warning for long stretches of time. During offline or
                  low-storage situations, there are still critical parts of the
                  publication that are consumable, mainly the text (and
                  possibly images). Having a reasonable fallback for video,
                  such as a poster image or placeholder image, would allow Nick
                  to read the content while offline or on a device with
                  limited storage.

                <li>Gösta is reading a treatise on the theory of functions.
                  A mathematical font is essential for the proper display
                  of the mathematical formula in this publication, so the author
                  has marked the font as essential so it is made available offline.</li>

                  dataset, consisting of millions of anonymized log files, is also
                  available. Because of its size, the researchers have marked the
                  dataset as non-essential for conveying the results of the paper and therefore
                  indicates it can be skipped when reading the publication
                  offline. </li>

                <li> Sarah is reading a publication about the stock exchange. The
                  current value of the stock is fetched (from a remote resource) when she opens the
                  publication. However, when she is on the train (without a connection) one week later
                  and opens the stock exchange publication, she will continue to see the value of the
                  stock as it was the last time she opened the
                  publication. It should be possible for either the content itself or the user agent to
                  provide some user experience that notifies her that the currently presented data is a
                  week old. </li>

                <li>Risha publishes an article which includes an interactive component
                  that accesses a database, exposed to the Web via a RESTful API. The
                  interactive component is implemented as a JavaScript library. Such data
                  cannot be included in a packaged publication and the interactive module is
                  of no use without such data. Risha therefore marks the Web Publication component
                  relative to the interactive module as not relevant when offline. </li>

         <h1>Archiving</h1>

         <p>We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of
         which have survived with little more than benign neglect. In contrast, digital
         documents are unlikely to persist without more active interventions, such as
         making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating integrity.
         Since future consumers of publications represent the most open-ended user
         group, it is desirable that digital documents be instilled with more of the
         inherent durability that characterizes print artifacts. Packaged Web Publications offer this
         potential, by making it easier for archiving services to locate, harvest,
         update, and describe digital publications. Long-term preservation of digital
         publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible, beyond the
         tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing
         platforms.</p>

         <p>Fundamental use cases and requirements already help aid our archiving requirements.

              Without such a mechanism, the archiving service will have to develop and maintain

                 preservation repository. A related process identifies and parses the

                 and the removal of others (i.e., the article content). An archiving
                 service regularly polls for changes to this article, which it has already
                 archived, and discovers the retraction. The archiving service retrieves
                 the new resources and record those that are no longer accessible, carrying

            Some publications may require additional capabilities (for example, access to camera or geolocation) that a user agent might normally not enable.
