        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely joined by hyperlinks. Clustering within domains, with explicit navigation elements built into them, webpages evolved into websites. This model however inherited very little from an existing, powerful and much older page-based media: books.</p>

        <p>Over centuries, “books” have assumed many forms: journals, magazines, pamphlets of longform articles and essays, newspapers, atlases, comics, notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different manifestations as “publications”: bound editions of meaningful media, made public.</p>

        <p>We believe there is great value in combining this older tradition — of portable, bounded publications — with the pervasive accessibility, addressability and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform. New models of economic sustainability, innovative experiences of knowledge and invigorated socio-cultural engagement depend on this.</p>

        <p>It is the task of this W3C Digital Publishing Interest Group to explore the uniqueness, desirability and feasibility of bringing these two great models of publishing together. We begin here by exploring examples of real world use cases &amp; scenarios.</p>

        <h1>Fundamental Features of a PWP</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Authors’ and readers’ requirements</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3>The publication should be readable in a browser</h3>
                    <p>Reading long form publications should not be restricted
                      to specific devices or applications but should be equally
                      available in a browser.</p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>Bob has some very specific plugins in his browser
                          that he enjoys using for, e.g., annotation using his
                          own annotation server, or quickly copy and publish
                          extracts in a specialized social service. That means
                          that he wants to be able to read his textbook in this
                          environment, enjoying the environment he is familiar
                          with, rather than being forced in to a special
                          application for the purpose of that specific
                          publication</li>

                        <li>Alice reads a scholarly paper that refers to large
                          datasets. The data can be presented interactively
                          through some very specialized data visualization
                          services relying on custom hardware on her computer.
                          These visualization services are incorporated into her
                          browser and can be used from within a web page. Alice
                          wants to make use of these wile reading her paper to
                          gain a better understanding of the content.</li>

                    <h3>The publication should conform to all the requirements of horizontal dependencies</h3>

                    <p>Web content has to be consumed under different circumstances: it must be available to the largest possible audience in a secure manner, providing the necessary protection of the reader’s privacy. Publication content must be able to answer to a number of principles like accessibility, internationalization, device independence, security, or privacy. (These are usually referred to, in the W3C context, as “horizontal” dependencies.) These principles are, in general terms:
                    </p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>(Web) Accessibility:</dt>
                        <dd>People with disabilities should be able to access the content, i.e., they should be able to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well as contribute to it. Accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the content, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.</dd>
                        <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
                        <dd>Publications should be well adapted to any language, writing systems, region, or culture. This includes the usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left, horizontal or vertical writing; item numbering, or interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of the right character sets and of local typographic conventions.</dd>
                        <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
                        <dd>Content should be usable on a large number of devices with very different device characteristics: different screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying level of processing power, etc. These different affordances should be automatic with no, or very little user intervention.</dd>
                        <dt>Security:</dt>
                        <dd>Publications should prevent malicious attacks, data theft, etc., even if they contain secure mashups, access to distributed services, etc. Consuming the content should not jeopardize the integrity of the underlying data, users’ privacy, or machine operations.</dd>
                        <dt>Privacy:</dt>
                        <dd>Content should maintain and support the user’s privacy, in spite of the fact that the evolution of online technologies has increased the possibility for the collection and processing of personal, and possibly sensitive, data, as well as the ability to ubiquitously track the users' online activity.</dd>
                    </dl>

                    <p>These principles correspond to technical requirements on the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its possible extension for PWP) insofar as the technologies <em>must empower the authors</em> (writers, editors, publishers, etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether authors use the possibilities of these technologies or not is not addressed in this document.</p>

                    <p>All these constraints are usually formalized in the context of the usage on the Web, but they are also valid for publications in general <em>regardless of whether they are online or offline, or whether the publication is distributed as a single unit or not</em>. Actually, in some cases, for example due to legislative reasons, the demands on digital publications may be more stringent than for generic Web sites. The use cases below provide some examples for the publication-specific situations.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>(<b>On Accessibility</b>) Asmait uses a dedicated braille e-reader capable of using standard Open Web technologies, that can render any WCAG-compliant content. She needs to be able to read her newspaper and contribute to the interactive discussion components on her dedicated braille reader, not just a standard browser and computer combination. </li>

                        <li>(<b>On Accessibility</b>) Legal Publishing Ltd. publishes all the official texts, as issued by the government of its country. Per local legislation, the publication MUST be accessible, following W3C’s WCAG Level AA requirements, to serve as official references in courts.</li>

                        <li>(<b>On Privacy, Accessibility</b>) EducationPublishing Ltd. publishes digital textbooks to cover BigUniversity’s curriculae. These (digital) educational publications also include access to interactive tests via specialized services on the Web that regularly access the student’s progress. The privacy and the integrity of the student’s test data must be preserved (whether they are embedded in the publication or online). This, and the fact that digital textbooks must also abide to WCAG Level AA requirement in terms of accessibility, are such that EducationPublishing is liable in case they are not fulfilled.</li>

                        <li>(<b>On Internationalization</b>) PublicationInternational SA. publishes literary work all over the world and in many languages. In order to continue its business in, e.g., Japan, it must be able to produce digital publications with right-to-left and vertical writing, and following the Japanese typesetting traditions, because that is the only way those publications are accepted by local customers.</li>

                        <li>(<b>On Device Independence</b>) Vera has several devices she uses to read her books, depending on where she is. She may use her table with a larger screen when sitting in an armchair at home, she uses her phone when commuting to her work by train, and uses her laptop when adding more complex annotations to the book. The book is authored in a way that, while maintaing the integrity of data like bookmarks and annotations, the book is automatically adapted to a different screen size, or to the fact that her phone does not have a keyboard.</li>

                        <li>(<b>On Security</b>) BigAirline uses digital versions of the airline manuals. This means that the manuals are put “online” to keep them up-to-date, and the pilots have access to the latest version even when they are flying, i.e., they are off line. The way the manuals are authors and managed ensures that the integrity of the manuals and the relevant data is maintained at all times, to secure that the pilots operate based on correct information only.</li>

                    <h3>PWPs should be able to make use of all facilities
                      offered by the Open Web Platform</h3>

                    <p>There is a formidable development of visualization systems,
                      interactive tools, and other powerful facilities that are
                      built on top of the Open Web Platform, including accessing
                      external services like Wolfram Alfa. These tools have
                      been traditionally developed for browsers, and provide
                      possibilities that traditional publications (books,
                      magazines, scholarly papers, educational materials, etc.)
                      should also benefit from. That requires publications to
                      become first class citizens on the Web platforms. </p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>For scholarly publishing, Web-only publications
                          gradually become part of the mainstream (e.g., the
                          multidisciplinary
                          <a href="http://www.plosone.org">PLOS ONE</a> or the
                          new
                          <a href="https://peerj.com/computer-science/">PeerJ
                            CompSci</a> journals) with the main content being
                            published using traditional Web technologies like
                            HTML and CSS. These publications increasingly use
                            additional media such as video, audio, animated
                            graphics, or very large images, and the trend is
                            to consider these as integral parts of the
                            scientific output. (
                            <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike
                              Bostock’s recent article on visualizing
                              algorithms</a> or the “live” presentation of data
                              in a <a href="http://f1000research.com/articles/3-176/v2">
                                paper published by F1000 Research</a> are good
                                examples for the new possibilities.) This means
                                the publications need access to the latest
                                visualization, data management, etc, tools that
                                the Open Web Platform based tools can offer.</li>

                        <li>Educational materials are increasingly making use
                          of Open Web Platform facilities. They include
                          runnable program snippets, interactive testing tools
                          (linked to online evaluation facilities); in many
                          respect, the borderline between these publications
                          and Web Applications is becoming fuzzy.</li>

                        <li id="in_house_doc">A special form of document are
                          “in-house” documents, whose production is related to
                          technical and/or user documentation of complex
                          products as well as complex administrative documents.
                          The sheer quantity and complexity of production, as
                          well as confidentiality requirements, mean that the
                          production are done in-house. In many respects major
                          corporations such as IBM, Intel, Renault, or Boeing,
                          or institutions like the European Commission, the FAO,
                          or the UNESCO have become specialized publishers
                          themselves. The quantity of documentation makes it
                          infeasible to produce these documents in print (or
                          print-only); instead, publishing them on the public
                          Web, an Intranet, and/or providing them through
                          specialized mobile devices is the viable alternative.
                          The production of these documents has similar
                          challenges to scholarly publications like
                          accessibility issues, portability of annotations, or
                          the possible inclusion of complex media.</li>

                      “paginated” view</h3>

                    <p>Whereas a “scrolling” view is the dominating approach on
                      the Web in Web browsers, publications must provide the

                        Having a reasonable fallback for video (a poster image or placeholder image) would allow Nick to read the content while offline or in limited storage.

                        This would be up to the reading system to provide a mechanism, but having a way to denote critical and fallback assets ensures that an entire package need not be downloaded when not necessary.

        <h1>States of a Portable Web Publication</h1>

        <p>
            During the consumption of a publication, a user may change the “state” of their PWP.
            The states of a PWP reflects whether the document is online or offline, or whether it is packed (i.e., all constituents are packged in a, say, ZIP file) or not. These different states require a different behavior from the user agent, while some of the characteristics of the publication may be invariant across states. The table below shows the same publication (PWP) in the most typical states:
        </p>

        <table class="zebra">
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Online</th>
                <th>Offline</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Packed</th>
                <td>PWP as one archive file on a Web Server</td>
                <td>PWP as one archive file on a local disc</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Unpacked</th>
                <td>PWP spread over several files on a Web Server</td>
                <td>PWP spread over several files on a local disc</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <aside class="note">
            The terms “online” and “offline” are used in this document, but the borderline between these is not always clear cut. For example, a PWP can be on a local disc but accessed through a Web Server running on that machine (i.e., through a <code>http://localhost</code> URL): the behaviour of the client is identical to the situation when the publication is genuinely online, although, technically, the publication is clearly offline. Similarly, a remote file system can be mounted as a local disc, in which case a PWP can be accessed as a file though technically online. A more precise terminology would use the terms like “protocol” and “file” states, for what is colloquially called “online” and “offline” in this document.

        <p>The concept of states is related to <a href="#fundamental-online-offline"></a>, <a href="#fundamental-transition"></a> and <a href="#non-essential-resources"></a>.</p>

            <h3>Dynamic Content</h3>

            <p>
                It’s possible that certain items will be dynamic, requiring the use of an external resource (or server) to provide the data.
                In offline mode, the user may want to be alerted that content could not be obtained, or be shown some fallback set of data.
                In this case, being able to specify an explicit "no-connectivity" or "offline-mode" alternative would allow the publication author to have more control over the user's experience and replace a potential error-display with a limited subset of a good experience.

                    However, when Nick is on the train one week later and opens the stock exchange book, he sees the state of the stock exchange as it was the last time he opened his publication. A small alert is shown denoting that this data is a week old.

  <h1>Distribution, Sharing and External Resources</h1>

  <section>
   <h2>The distribution of a PWP should not affect its versioning</h2>
    <p>Simply distributing or sharing a PWP to multiple destinations and devices should not result in multiple versions of the PWP.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>Publisher Corp. Inc. publishes a new PWP and sends it to its distributors and customers. This PWP is downloaded to devices, or synced across several devices, or made available to a customer-specific cloud. Customers can access this file from different retailers, through different applications, either directly or downloaded from a private cloud. Thus, the PWP is duplicated many times, resulting in a huge number of items. There is one source manifestation, therefore one canonical identifier for a large number of items spread across devices and buyers. Those items should not be different versions of the source PWP unless they contain modifications that make them different PWPs.</li>
      <li>Mary creates a PWP and sends it to Dave and Kristin, who each send it to two friends, who then send it on to their friends. Ultimately there are many copies of Mary's PWP but they are not different versions unless they have been altered; one shall say that they are all “the same” PWP.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The distribution of PWPs should conform to the standard processes and expectations of commercial publishing channels.</h2>
    <ul class="use-cases">
       <li>Ahmed acquires a PWP on an e-commerce platform. He expects to be able to receive the PWP as a file (rather than only having access to it) and to be able to load it onto its different reading  devices.</li>
       <li>Bridget buys (rather than subscribes to) a PWP. She expects to have permanent access to that PWP and to be able to make reasonable use of it.</li>
       <li>Alice acquires a PWP through a subscription service and downloads it. When, later on, she decides to unsubscribe from the service, this PWP becomes unavailable to her.</li>
       <li>Bill acquires a PWP through a rental service. After a certain period, this PWP becomes unavailable to him.</li>
       <li>Slicendice Publishing publishes many PWPs, some of which are different versions or subsets or combinations of others. Slicendice needs not only to be able to uniquely identify each unique PWP but also to identify each "copy" or "delivery" ("item") of each of those PWPs so that it can track "what" has been sold and "how many" of each one have been sold.</li>
       <li>Cobble-It Publishing creates PWPs from a mix of internal content and content licensed from other parties. Using PWP metadata, Cobble-It is able to keep track of the rights associated with the different components so that it can realize income from its own IP and appropriately compensate the parties whose IP it has licensed.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>PWPs should support cross-references that can be resolved locally or externally.</h2>
    <p>A user should have an option to access their local copy of a PWP when there is a choice between a local copy and an external source.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
     <li>Writer Annie writes a dissertation. She references her Master's thesis, which is published on the university website. Her colleague Bob has read her Master's thesis before and has annotated his copy. When he clicks the reference in Annie's dissertation, he gets redirected to his local copy of Annie's Master's thesis. Her friend, Charlie, hasn't read her Master's thesis before. Charlie needs to be online when clicking the reference in order to access Annie's Master's thesis on the university website.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Several PWPs may share external resources.</h2>
    <p>In order to make serial publications lighter and speed up processing, PWP should support the injection of external resources.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>EsteemedPublisher creates a software application to distribute daily journals to readers. These journals share script libraries, CSS files, images and other resources, that are downloaded once in a while by the reading application and cached.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>PWPs should be able to access external data.</h2>
    <p>Requirement 2.1.13 states that “There should be a way to differentiate between essential and non-essential resources”; essential resources must be included in the offline version; non-essential resources may be either included also, or accessed online when possible. It is up to the packaging software to decide which resources will be included, and which won’t.</p>
    <p>This requirement adds the possibility to specify that some data must stay external to the packaged publication.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>Rosa has submitted an article to EsteemedJournal and provided her research data in CSV format. She and EsteemedJournal wish to provide users access to the CSVs when accessing her article, but they decide to inactivate the inclusion of the research data in the packaged publication. Albert reads Rosa’s article from a packaged version. When online, he can access the research data, but when offline, he cannot access it and its reading system fails gracefully.</li>
      <li>Risha publishes an article which includes an interactive component relying on a database access, exposed to the Web as a REST API. The interactive component is implemented as a Javascript library. Such data cannot be included in a packaged publication and the interactive module is of no use without such data. Risha therefore marks the PWP component relative to the interactive module as “not packageable”. Albert reads Risha’s article from a packaged version. When online, he can access the interactive module, but when offline, he cannot access it and its reading system fails gracefully.</li>
      <li>InteractiveCompany publishes a PWP containing an interactive component implemented as a Javascript library, but this library requires several other JS libraries. The interactive component has not been marked as “not packageable”. The reading system therefore packages all JS libraries required to get the interactive component running offline, with a recursive inspection of the JS code.</li>

    <h1>Manifests</h1>

    <p>In this document by <em>manifest</em> we mean an abstract place, typically one or several files, that contain information necessary to the proper management, rendering, etc, of the publication. This is opposed to <em>metadata</em> that contain information on the <em>content</em> of the publication like author, publication date, etc.</p>

    <p>Some fundamental use cases and requirements already imply the usage of manifests, e.g.:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#find-information"></a></li>
        <li><a href="#reading-order"></a></li>
    </ul>

    <section id="technical-metadata">
      <h2>Manifests should include the technical and descriptive metadata and basic characteristics of the constituent resources</h2>

      <p>A user agent requires information about the package and its components in order to process it. E.g., performance and memory requirements may prevent a user agent from parsing a large number of content documents in order to discover the necessary components and their relationships. A user agent may need to make some decisions about how to present content before displaying it.</p>

      <p>Some necessary features are listed among the fundamental features of a PWP (see <a href="#find-information"></a>); the use cases below provide a (non-exhaustive) list of further information.</p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>A user agent may not be able to process files beyond a certain size due to bandwidth, storage or memory limitations, or processing time expectations. Hence this information should be available in advance.</li>

        <li>A user agent should be able to process permissions and rights information for each component identified in the package. For example, it need to know whether it has the rights to place an image of the Mona Lisa owned by the Louvre in a package to be downloaded offline.</li>

        <li>A user agent should be able to determine if captions are available for multimedia resources within the publication.</li>

        <li>For further processing the user agent needs to have access to additional information including:
            <ul>
                <li>the accessibility of each component;</li>
                <li>whether it needs additional processing instructions, such as with MathML;</li>
                <li>the title, author(s), cover image, etc., to display the publication on a shelf without downloading all its content;</li>
                <li>whether the content is unaltered;</li>
                <li>the origin of the publication.</li>

        <h2>The manifest should provide access to the general metadata of a publication</h2>
        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>The manifest may be a "first point of entry" for the user agent when getting hold of a publication, and should therefore provide an easy way to get hold of the general descriptive publication metadata (e.g., author’s and publisher’s data, library data, copyright information, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Manifest should make it possible to provide a streamlined access to disjoint parts of the publication</h2>

      <p>It should be possible for the author to convey several reading orders for the content of the publication, that may go beyond the “default” <a href="reading-order">reading order</a>. Furthermore, this alternative reading order may not necessary include the full content of the publication but only specific parts thereof.</p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
          <li>EsteemedJournalPublisher would like to offer the users of the EsteemedJournal of Chemistry App the opportunity to read only the abstracts of the journals in the app. The App Package must offer the user a list (table of contents) of abstracts (disjoint objects in the package with semantic information or metadata informing the package of the nature of the object). </li>

          <li>The publisher wants to provide “teasers” for a book by providing a series of extracts that are meant to give an overview of the book without the necessity to read the whole publication. This can be typically used by a reseller allowing for a prospective client to access part of the publication free of charge.</li>
        </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Manifest should include information of new content</h2>

      <p>The manifest should include information that makes it possible for a user agent to find out whether a specific content has changed since a last access or not.

      <p>The fundamental requirement on identification already states that there should be a way to uniquely identify a publication (see <a href="#unique-identifier"></a>). This requirement should be extended to resources <em>within</em> a publication, e.g., a chapter, an image, a mathematical formula.

    <h2>Locators</h2>

    <section>
        <h1>Locating the Same Publication Across States</h1>

        <p>
            A user reads a publication across states. When providing a pointer to (a part of) a publication, this should be robust across states. Locating a resource within a PWP should not depend on the PWP's state.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some use cases, documented separately&nbsp;[[dpub-annotation-uc]] for the purpose of annotations, imply this issue:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-annotation-uc/#cross-format-annotations">2.3.1. Cross Format annotations</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-annotation-uc/#cross-version-annotations">2.3.2. Cross Version annotations</a></li>
        </ul>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>
                Writer Annie has her book published on her own web space as a PWP.
                Reader Bob opens it online using a dedicated PWP reader, and highlights a nice quote.
                When Bob reads the same book later on, the highlight is retrieved, whether the PWP is opened using the same PWP reader, opened in a browser, downloaded locally, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                Annie sends Bob the state-independent locator to the second chapter of ‘Moby Dick’ while reading it online.
                Bob can use that state-independent locator for his own copy of ‘Moby Dick’, even though it is loaded from a local package.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">
            Highlights are, in this case, Web Annotations&nbsp;[[annotation-model]], i.e., stored online with links to the highlighted text.

    <section>
        <h3>State-Independent vs. State-Dependent Locators</h3>
        <p>
            To be able to connect the same publication across status, there needs to be a common, state-independent locator. This state-independent locator (also known as the canonical locator&nbsp;[[rfc6596]] should be part of the PWP. There MUST be a separation between a format-independent (“canonical”) and format-dependent locator and it MUST be possible (and necessary) to use, for all cross-references, the canonical locator.
        </p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>
                Annie sends Bob the state-independent locator to the second chapter of ‘Moby Dick’ while reading it online.
                Bob opens that state-independent locator &mdash; whilst he is offline &mdash; in his e-reader with his copy of ‘Moby Dick’ loaded.
                The e-reader can direct him to the correct chapter, with no additional online connection needed.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Relative Locators</h3>

        <p>Relative locators are abundant on the Web. State-independent locators should not break this mechanism. It SHOULD be possible to use, in all circumstances, a relative locator to refer to content within a PWP. A PWP Processor MUST be able to combine a relative locator with the canonical as well as state dependent locators of a PWP.</p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>
                Nick creates his own short story.
                Based on choices of the reader, the story is different (e.g.: `If you want to go into the rabbit hole, see <a href="#">chapter 3</a>, otherwise, see <a href="#">chapter 4</a>`).
                He publishes this PWP online with relative links between the different chapters.
                When Annie downloads this publication as a package, all the relative links still work as expected, regardless of the state the publication is in when Annie reads it.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Publishing Multiple States</h3>

        <p>Any server-side configuration required to enable handling of canonical and state-dependent locators, MUST be well documented and readily apparent to anyone that would need to perform this work.</p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>
                Bob is an independent writer.
                He can publish all his PWPs using a popular cloud storage provider that has enabled their system to correct process locators.
            </li>
            <li>
                Annie is a more tech-savvy independent writer.
                She publishes her PWPs in multiple states using her own standard (eg. Apache/Nginx/&hellip;) server and is able to follow the provided instructions to enable locators.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Identifiers</h3>
        <p>
            Identification of a publication is orthogonal to the issue of locators. There are no specific requirements on identification of PWP-s in this document in general; however, any such identifier MUST be usable across states and MUST NOT conflict with locators. There needs to be persistence of identifiers across PWP instances.
        </p>

        <aside class="note">
            This does not imply that the same PWP in different states is required to use the same identifier.
        </aside>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>Zoltán publishes a scholarly article in PWP format. The publisher assigns a <a href="http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a> to the publication, which becomes its unique identifier. Zoltán’s colleague, Sean, downloads a copy of the article to his own user space; the copy receives a new locator corresponding to Sean’s Web space. However, the paper’s DOI remains unchanged, and is to be used as an unambiguous reference by Sean.</li>

  <h1>Archiving</h1>
  <p>We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of which have survived with little more than benign neglect. In contrast, digital documents are unlikely to persist without more active interventions, such as making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating integrity. Since future consumers of publications represent the most open-ended user group, it is desirable that digital documents be instilled with more of the inherent durability that characterizes print artifacts. PWP offers this potential, by making it easier for archiving services to locate, harvest, update, and describe digital publications. Long-term preservation of digital publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible, beyond the tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing platforms.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>The locations of all PWP components should be discoverable</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn where all of the components that constitute a PWP are located in order to be able to archive it. Without such a mechanism, the archiving service will have to develop and maintain publisher- and/or platform-specific heuristics for packaging collections of interlinked resources into discrete publications, making archiving more expensive and error-prone.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
	  <li>An archiving service sets out to conduct an initial harvest of a book. They are able to locate all of the images, markup, scripts, and style and layout instructions that constitute the object.

    <h2>There should be a way to discover that a new version of one or more PWP components have been published</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn that a new version of one or more PWP components have been published (i.e., at the same locations as previously) in order to be able to archive them. Without such a mechanism, the archiving service will have to periodically re-download and re-checksum all PWP components to determine whether any updates have transpired, unnecessarily increasing the load on archiving service and publisher servers and delaying updated PWP components from being archived.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>An archiving service regularly polls for changes to an article that it has already archived. One such poll indicates that several Resources that constitute the object have changed.

  <section>
    <h2>There should be a way to discover that one or more PWP components have been removed from a PWP</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn that one or more PWP components have been removed from a PWP in order to be able to propagate this change to the archive. Without such a mechanism, there is a possibility that the archiving service will mistakenly make PWP components accessible that should not be.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>A publisher issues a retraction for a published article, resulting in the addition of new Resources to the object (i.e., the retraction notice) and the removal of others (i.e., the article content).

The archiving service retrieves the new Resources and record those that are no longer accessible, carrying over the cumulative updates to a preservation repository.</li>
      <li>A copyright dispute results in the takedown of a published book. An archiving service regularly polls for changes to this book, which it has already archived, and discovers that it has been taken down.

  <section>
    <h2>There should be a way to indicate whether one or more PWP components contain structured descriptive metadata</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to determine which, if any, PWP components contain structured descriptive metadata. Without such a mechanism, the archiving service will have to develop and maintain publisher- and/or platform-specific heuristics for locating or parsing out descriptive metadata, making archiving more expensive and decreasing the reliability of reporting.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>An archiving service sets out to conduct an initial harvest of an article. Along with the images, markup, scripts, and style and layout instructions that constitute the object, it is able to locate a file containing descriptive metadata. The archiving service retrieves these resources and packages them into a logical archival unit for ingest into a preservation repository. A related process identifies and parses the descriptive metadata structure and saves its contents into an associated management database.</li>

    <h2>Adding Alternative Media</h2>
    <p>A PWP must support the ability to include multiple renditions of a publication.  Within their publication in additon to the print rendition a publisher may include a fully narrated rendition, or a video with described audio and captioning.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>As a publisher of accessible content, I need to add content such as a braille style sheet, image descriptions, or video captioning (text / descriptive audio) to a PWP previously published by a third party.</li>
        <li>Frank has dyslexia and finds reading printed books a very frustrating experience.  Having a book read to him with synchronized highlighting of the text not only allows him to comprehend the book but helps him become a better reader.</li>

     <h2>Braille</h2>
       <p>There is an important difference between just sending the raw text to a braille display which will translate the text to the default braille grade and language the braille display is using and having a pre-formatted braille rendition using a specific braille table.</p>
     <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>As a publisher wanting to fulfill my legal requirements in creating an accessible Math textbook, to this end the inclusion of math equation examples in both Braille as well as MathML is desired since not all reading systems fully support MathML.  Nemeth Braille is primarily used and has therefore been added as a separate preformatted Nemeth Braille examples to my publication in addition to the MathML.</li>

         <li>Alberto who has been blind since birth is studying to become an engineer.

As a high-quality, accessible news site, it's multimedia presentations come with captions and transcripts. Buffy does not want to waste her data plan on the useless-to-her audio and video content. She'd like to build a PWP which contains the captions and transcripts, but not the data-heavy videos.</li>
       <li>Smitha has limited hand mobility, and controls her e-reader by voice. She subscribes to her monthly comics online. The comics contain interactive dialogue sections where, instead of advancing pages the a more conventional method, readers click-and-drag the panels around the page. The fallback method to make this accessible is the more conventional page-turning method. Smitha wants to download her monthly comics in the smaller fallback format, rather than download the to-her unusable packages which she is then required to individually reconfigure.</li>

     <p>Anna is a self-publishing author. Anna creates a PWP, both packed and
        unpacked. Anna uses some cloud storage system such as DropBox to publish
        her PWP online. Her friend Bob is able to read Anna's PWP online and
        offline, either packed or unpacked, as Bob sees fit.</p>

      <h2>Online Discovery</h2>
      <p>As a reader, I want to discover a publication on the web so that I can
          start reading it right away. </p>

    <h2>Platform Independence</h2>
    <p>Publisher ACME creates a publication that is consumable across a variety
      of reader platforms, whether online or offline.</p>

  <h1>Security</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>User Agents must be allowed to limit the capabilities of Portable Web Publications</h2>
    <p>The compatibility and interoperability requirements of the specification must not prevent User Agents from taking measures to protect the security, safety, or privacy of the User. Security-conscious systems that interlink an unusually large number of important services and have an unusually large attack surface (such as web browsers or web services) have stricter security requirements than standalone apps that are siloed from the web. They must be allowed to continue to fulfil their pre-existing security requirements as they implement support for the Portable Web Publications format.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>Alice opens a malicious PWP in her browser. The malicious PWP tries to exploit a flaw in a social media service to take over her account but blocked by her browser’s security measures.</li>
      <li>Joe, a student, has completed his classroom assignment which was to use PWP annotations to complete the text’s quizzes, and uploads the document to the school’s classroom management web service. The teacher can safely read the PWP on the web because the service has automatically stripped the document of all untrusted scripts.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Capabilities discovery</h2>
    <p>A document’s access to features and APIs will vary from platform to platform, app to app. Document authors would benefit from being able to discover what capabilities their documents will have access to. </p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>Luke has written a nonfiction book on web development. To discover which APIs he can demonstrate directly in the PWP and which he can’t he uses a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/permissions/" title="W3C - Permissions">permissions API</a> combined with feature detection to let the text discover what capabilities it has access to at each read. standardising an "always available" safe subset of the platform's capabilities, or documenting specific methods progressive enhancement or graceful degradation that the author should be able to use to safely create their documents.</li>
      <li>Jill has written a detailed data analysis report for her manager that uses complex interactive graphs to display the results. These graphs work in the manager’s User Agent because the script driving them uses a previously specified ‘always safe’ API subset that User Agent’s have committed to enabling even when the capabilities of the document are otherwise limited, e.g. for security.</li>
      <li>Jack has written an interactive children’s book. Because he has followed published guidelines on how to make texts that progressively enhance or gracefully degrade, all of his readers can experience the text, even if they don’t have access to all the features, all the time.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Preserving the integrity of the document</h2>
    <p>Scripted documents are dynamic by nature. Long-lived authored documents are vulnerable to alteration by a variety of external factors. PWP authors should be able to embed guidance policies in their documents that inform the User Agent of their preferences as to how the integrity and security of the document itself should be preserved. This mechanism should be based on the pre-existing <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/" title="W3C - Content Security Policy">Content Security Policy</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/" title="W3C - Subresource Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a> specifications and not be a new invention incompatible with web browser CSP implementations.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>Jill’s data analysis report used an externally hosted script to generate her interactive graphs. To ensure that these scripts do not violate her manager’s privacy, she includes a CSP whitelist in the document that tells the User Agent that it should only load that external script and not any of the third party services the script wants to load as well.</li>
      <li>After Jill’s report has been in the archive for a year, Simon, the manager, wants to revisit the analysis for his own end-of-year report. But because the domain for the external web service has lapsed, it has been taken over by a malicious actor who replaced its scripted graphs with graphs that display random numbers and nonsense. But because Jill’s authoring system used Subresource Integrity attributes the User Agent refuses to load the malware and instead the document degrades gracefully to showing static—correct—graphs.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Escalating trust</h2>
    <p>Platform vendors have sometimes offered methods for otherwise untrusted local scripts to become trusted and regain API privileges that the had lost while untrusted. User Agents may provide a method for escalating trust so that publications the UA otherwise would have limited for security reasons may gain access to more capabilities.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>Luke has written another book, this time using all of the capabilities of the web platform that he can think of. He submits the book for review to a PWP retail platform. After review, the book is listed in the retailer’s store. When bought, the book runs with the full capabilities of the platform because it has been code signed by the platform vendor.</li>
