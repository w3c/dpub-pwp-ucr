        A Portable Web Publication is a collection of content items (e.g.,
        pages, chapters, modules, articles) whose content is compatible with
        Web usage, and structured as a single, self-contained logical unit.
        This document describes the use cases that inform the requirements
        for a Portable Web Publication, and should be read as part of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp/">Portable Web Publications for
        the Open Web Platform</a>.

        <h2>Fundamental Features of a PWP</h2>
        <section>
            <h2>Authors’ and readers’ requirements</h2>
                <section>
                    <h2>PWP-s should be able to make use of all facilities offered by the Open Web Platform</h2>

                    <p>There is a formidable development visualization systems, interactive tools, and other powerful facilities that are built on top of the Open Web Platform. These tools have been traditionally developed for browsers, and provide possibilities that traditional publications (books, magazines, scholarly papers, educational materials, etc.) should also benefit from. That requires publications to become first class citizens on the Web platforms. </p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>For scholarly publishing, Web-only publications gradually become part of the mainstream (e.g., the multidisciplinary <a href="http://www.plosone.org">PLOS ONE</a> or the new <a href="https://peerj.com/computer-science/">PeerJ CompSci</a> journals) with the main content being published using traditional Web technologies like HTML and CSS. These publications increasingly use additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics, or very large images, and the trend is to consider these as integral parts of the scientific output. (<a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike Bostock’s recent article on visualizing algorithms</a> or the “live” presentation of data in a <a href="http://f1000research.com/articles/3-176/v1#f3">paper published by F1000 Research</a> are good examples for the new possibilities.) This means the publications need access to the latest visualization, data management, etc, tools that the Open Web Platform based tools can offer.</li>

                        <li>Educational materials are increasingly making use of Open Web Platform facilities. They include runnable program snippets, interactive testing tools (linked to online evaluation facilities); in many respect, the borderline between these publications and Web Applications is becoming fuzzy.</li>

                        <li id="in_house_doc">A special form of document are “in-house” documents, whose production is related to technical and/or user documentation of complex products as well as complex administrative documents. The sheer quantity and complexity of production, as well as confidentiality requirements, mean that the production are done in-house. In many respects major corporations such as IBM, Intel, Renault, or Boeing, or institutions like the European Commission, the FAO, or the UNESCO have become specialized publishers themselves. The quantity of documentation makes it infeasible to produce these documents in print (or print-only); instead, publishing them on the public Web, an Intranet, and/or providing them through specialized mobile devices is the viable alternative. The production of these documents has similar challenges to scholarly publications like accessibility issues, portability of annotations, or the possible inclusion of complex media.</li>

                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The publication should be readable in a browser</h2>
                    <p>Reading long form publications should not be restricted to specific devices or applications but should be equally available in a browser.</p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>Bob has some very specific plugins in his browser that he enjoys using for, e.g., annotation using his own annotation server, or quickly copy and publish extracts in a specialized social service. That means that he wants to be able to read his textbook in this environment, enjoying the environment he is familiar with, rather than being forced in to a special application for the purpose of that specific publication</li>

                        <li>Alice reads a scholarly paper that refers to large datasets. The data can be presented interactively through some very specialized data visualization services relying on custom hardware on her computer. These visualization services are incorporated into her browser and can be used from within a web page. Alice wants to make use of these wile reading her paper to gain a better understanding of the content.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>It should be possible to see the publication in a “paginated” view</h2>

                    <p>Whereas a “scrolling” view is the dominating approach on the Web in Web browsers, publications must provide the possibility to switch to a paginated view if the user so desires or as the author suggests. Pagination may automatically adapt page sizes to the device’s or the browser’s viewport, and may contain separate headers, footers, possibly page numbers.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>Ann reads the War and Peace which, when printed, is over 2000 pages. For usability reasons (e.g., to give her a better sense of where she “is” within the book, to give her a bounded view of a portion of the text that would help her navigate) she decides to swith her reading environment to paged view to enjoy the novel.</li>
                        <li>The author of a history book has carefully crafted, using CSS, images, flexboxes, etc., the book on the history of a city so that each major milestone is defined as a standalone unit that would be a single page when printed, with a timeline with the main events in the footer area of the page.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>The same PWP content may have to be accessed both online and offline</h2>
                    <p>The <em>same</em> content of the PWP should be accessible offline, if circumstances so dictate, without the necessity for the reader to take any particular, technical actions.</p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>Connectivity as a commodity; students reading a digital textbook in a village in Africa should be prepared to the fact that the connection may not be reliable.</li>

                        <li>Many institutions, such as schools and government organizations (even in the wealthiest countries), do not have the resources to update equipment frequently. Therefore, it is necessary for publications to be accessible on current as well as older browsers.</li>

                        <li>Readers, who can enjoy reading their favourite book on their portable device in their home countries would find it prohibitive to do the same doing the same, due to the very high roaming charters.</li>

                        <li><a href="#in_house_doc">“In house” documents</a> may have to be accessed both online and offline, depending on the access point. While online access might be beneficial when done from the work floor (e.g., at an airplane production line), the same documents may need reliable offline access (e.g., in the cockpit).</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>There should be a very smooth transition between offline and online states of the same publication</h2>

                    <p>Accessing a document online or offline should not be made through conversions from one storage format to the other, but should be as transparent as possible to the reader, requiring only a very minimal (ideally no) interaction from her part.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>Reviewing a scholary publication is an essential facility. In practice, reviewing is often done offline (e.g., in a plane, while commuting on a train, etc.). Reviewing means annotations, notes, highlights, possibly changes on the content itself. These annotations and changes should not be bound to a specific device used at the time of reading; they should be smoothly transferred to, e.g., the server of the journal when back online.</li>

                        <li>Many publications—especially long form fiction and non-fiction—that users engage with for many hours. During this time, the user may shift states in many ways—starting consumption on an internet enabled PC, moving to an internet enabled portable device, going into offline-mode on that device, and then back to the PC. Ensuring a smooth transition also means that bookmarks, current reading position, etc, are stored, without the need of a central server that may lead to privacy concerns.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>It should be possible to create and distribute a “packaged” form of a publication</h2>

                <section>
                    <h2>A publication may consist of a collection of Resources</h2>
                    <p>A Portable Web Publications would, usually, consists of a (possibly large) number of Web Resources, like HTML, SVG, or CSS. This reflects the current practice on the Web, emphasizing the need of memory requirement on small devices, cachebility, or independent development</p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>Publisher “P” works with multiple authors to create an anthology and uses resources from different locations on the web. Following the current practice on the Web, the publication consists of many different resources (HTML, SVG, CSS, etc.), with some of the HTML contents formatted by, possibly, different CSS files. The publisher needs the collection of all the resources as a unit to include it into its business workflow. </li>

                        <li>A book on wines that can be read from A-Z, or personalized to only read about red wines or wines from a specific region. Each wine may be a resources/small chunk of data that is used to generate the corresponding HTML content on the fly.</li>

                        <li>User “A” has access to materials only through an old computer in her local library. While she has time to read the entire copy of War and Peace, the system is unable to display the entire resource as one huge HTML file. Parsing through one 2000-page HTML document is difficult and resource-intensive. Parsing through a package of 20 HTML documents, roughly 10 pages each, is less resource-intensive.</li>
                    </ul>

              <section>
                  <h2>Find the information on the constituent resources of a PWP easily</h2>

                  <p>A PWP will likely be composed of multiple web documents. A more complicated PWP may have many more components, meaning that extracting in advance all the references to other constituent resources may be prohibitive. It is therefore necessary for the reading system to have an easy access to the list of constituent resources.
                  </p>

                  <ul class="use-cases">
                      <li>The system needs to identify which components need to be downloaded to a local user’s device to support offline reading</li>
                      <li>The system needs to preload some document components in order to provide a more responsive reading experience.</li>
                      <li>When creating a packaged publication it must be clear which documents should or should not be added to the distribution package</li>
                  </ul>
              </section>

              <section>
                  <h2>Find the reading order of the resources of a PWP easily</h2>

                  <p>A user agent needs to know the sequence in which to present components of a PWP to the user. A PWP will likely be composed of multiple web documents. A typical simple PWP will anywhere from 1 to 15 HTML documents and several image files, in one location or many. A more complicated PWP may have many more components, meaning that extracting the exact order from within the resources (i.e., parsing them in advance to extract the information) may be prohibitive. It is therefore necessary for the reading system to have an easy access to the reading order constituent resources.
                  </p>

                  <ul class="use-cases">
                      <li>Moby Dick contains 136 chapters. Each chapter is a separate HTML document. The user agent must present the chapters sequentially.</li>
                      <li>The Encyclopedia of Stuff includes 1348 articles, each one in a unique HTML document. The user agent must present the articles in order (alphabetically, by title).

                  <h2>There should be a way to uniquely identify a publication regardless of its state</h2>

                  <p>A unique identification of a specific publication, regardless of whether it is online or offline, or whether it is part of a web site or a single (packaged) file is essential. This unique identification should be mapped onto the “real” location of the publication smoothly, without the author’s interaction.
                  </p>

                  <ul class="use-cases">
                      <li>Digital publications make use of interactive cross references within the publication (references to indeces, images, etc). These references should be done once by the author and should work regardless of whether the publication is online or offline, for example.
                      </li>

                      <li>Scholarly references demand a unique identification of the publication and, possibly, it internal structure. That unique identification must be available as a Web link, to make it possible for other publications and other sites (e.g., the authors’ institutional sites) to unumbigously link to the publication. These features are essential in the scholarly community to make, for example, the assessment of individual researchers possible.</li>

   <p>As a reading system, I need to know which files are required or essential
    for the user to perceive the content.</p>
  <p>As a reading system, I need to know enough about the publication efficiently
    and without preprocessing.</p>
  <p>As a reading system, I need to know the title and cover image to display
    the publication on a shelf without downloading all it's content.</p>
  <p>As a reading system, I need to know if I need additional processing
    instructions, such as with MathML.</p>
  <p>As a reading system, I need to know if I have the rights to put the resource
    offline.</p>
  <p>As a reading sytem, I need to know when all the files are delivered, and that
    if a file is not in the manifest, I will not process it.</p>
  <p>As a reading system, I need descriptions about the publication that travel
    with the publication whether online or offline. For example: author(s), title,
    size, rights and permissions, accessibility, multimedia details.</p>
  <p>As a reading system, I want to know that the content is unaltered.</p>
  <p>As a reading system, I want to know if the content is intentionally
    updated.</p>
  <p>As a reading system, I want to know the origin of the publication.</p>

  <h2>Use Cases - Changing State</h2>
<section>
  <h2>State Changing Document</h2>
  <p>Many publications - especially long form fiction and non-fiction - that
     users engage with for many hours. During this time, the user may shift
     states in many ways - starting consumption on an internet enabled PC,
     moving to an internet enabled portable device, going into offline-mode
     on that device, and then back to the PC.</p>

 <p>During all of these experiences, the user needs to ensure they have
    access to critical pieces of data while secondary assets have a pre-
    defined fallback that will allow the user to continue (for example, a
    poster image of a video that serves as a placeholder for an externally
    streamed video when internet is available).</p>

 <p>Lets take the use case of a user, Let's call him Nick. Nick is reading
    long-form narrative non-fiction. A publication filled with text, images,
    sounds, and multi-media files. Nick is also a multi-device user who
    wishes to consume the publication on multiple devices. Some of those
    devices have limited storage, and some of them have limited connectivity.
    Nick also rides the subway - where he loses internet connection, without
    warning - for long stretches of time.</p>

 <p>During offline or low-storage situations, there are still critical parts
     of the publication that are consumable - mainly the text (and possibly
     images). Having a reasonable fallback for video (a poster image or
     placeholder image) would allow Nick to read the content while offline or
     in limited storage. While this should be the job of the reading system,
     having a method in the publication for the author of the publication to
     mark what items are critical, and what need a fallback for limited
     connectivity/storage situations would greatly help the reading system and
     give more control to the publisher to ensure consistent experience with
     consuming the publication.</p>

   <p>Nick may know he's going to be in a no-connectivity situation and may
     want to obtain and locally store the entire (even non-critical) contents.
     This would be up to the reading system to provide a mechanism, but having
     a way to denote critical and fallback assets ensures that an entire
     package isn't downloaded when not necessary.</p>

   <p>For the case of scripting - it's possible that certain items will be
     dynamic - and will hit an external resource (or server) to generate
     on-the-fly data. In offline mode, the user would want to be alerted that
     content could not be obtained, or be shown some fallback set of data. In t
     his case, being able to specify a "no-connectivity" or "offline-mode"
     alternative for scripts would allow the publication author to have more
     control over the user's experience and replace a potential error-display
     with a limited subset of a good experience.</p>

  namely, PWPRead-soft.</p>
   <p>PWPRead-soft synchronizes with Bob's PWPMark profile, and can
     show Bob's bookmarks when he continues reading [file/packed]</p>
</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Annotating Across States Via a Browser Plugin</h2>
  <p>Writer Annie has her book published on her own web space as a PWP
     [http/unpacked]. Reader Bob reads it online, and selects a nice quote
     to bookmark via its browser PWP bookmarking plugin: PWPMark-plugin.</p>
  <p>When Bob re-opens the PWP offline, the bookmarks are shown via
     PWPMark-plugin</p>
  <p>When Bob re-visits the original PWP, PWPMark-plugin can also show
     Bob's bookmarks in the online version.</p>

  <h2>Use Cases - Creating the PWP</h2>
<section>
 <h2>Configurability of Important Resources</h2>
 <p>Chef Bob writes a cookbook with a lot of embedded videos to explain
    certain techniques. Bob finds it very important that his videos remain
    available even offline, and configures this in his cookbook. Reader
    Annie starts reading Bob's cookbook online. When Annie gets disconnected,
    the fonts of the cookbook fall back to the system fonts, but the videos
    remain available.</p>

 <p>Typographer Charlie writes a book on typography, and configures
    differently: he finds fonts a very important aspect of his book, whilst
    the embedded videos may fall back to a still. Annie can read Charlie's
    book without err, online or offline. The fonts remain available, but the
    videos fall back to stills when offline.</p>

 <p>Author David does not configure anything to his novel, but still,
    Annie can read David's book without problems whether she is online
    or not.</p>
</section>

<section>
 <h2>Updating PWPs</h2>
 <p>Corp.Inc. creates a PWP with dynamically updatable stock exchange
    information on chapter 4. Anna sends the locator for chapter 4 to Bob
    on April 1st. When Bob reads the PWP offline, chapter 4 is filled with
    some default content. However, when Bob gets online and clicks on the
    locator for chapter 4, he gets the updated stock exchange information,
    which might be different than the stock exchange information that Anna
    saw when she created the bookmark.</p>

  <h2>Use Cases - Security</h2>
  <section>
    <h2>Read and Write Controls Required</h2>
    <p>Alice is working on potentially Nobel prize winning research, and has
      drafted her paper describing her discoveries. She asks Bob to review the
      paper, but needs to make sure that the PWP retains specific protections,
      regardless of whether it is read online or offline.</p>
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Use Cases - Sharing, Distribution, and External Resources</h2>
<section>
 <h2>Distribution</h2>
 <p>Publisher Corp. Inc. publishes a new PWP, and sends this PWP to ACME
    its customers. This PWP is downloaded to devices, or synced across
    several devices, or made available to a customer-specific cloud.
    Customers can access this file from different retailers, through different
    applications, either directly or downloaded from private cloud. Thus, the
    PWP is duplicated many, many, many, many, many times, resulting in a huge
    number of items. There is one source manifestation, one ISBN identifier,
    and lots of items spread across devices and buyers.</p>

 <p>Annie buys a book and downloads it offline. She bookmarks a certain
    chapter (i.e., creates a locator for that chapter). She sends that
    bookmark to Bob. Bob is able to use that locator on any item of the
    same PWP, and gets redirected to the correct chapter. </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Retail</h2>
  <p>(e)books that are sold need to be delivered, so that purchasers can load
    them on offline devices.</p>
  <p>Purchased content has different expectations - one being that you have
    “something” or a reasonable use of that content in a logical way (such as
    always being able to read your amazon purchases through the amazon app)</p>
  <p>The web is not permanent - sites go down, when you purchase a book, you
    need an offline copy that you can continue to read when the retailer you
    purchased from goes kaput…</p>
  <p>Sales Auditing -> Ability to track “what” is sold so that it can be paid.
    If all content is just free and different chunks are purchased, chasing
    rights/payments is an issue.  Basically the package can have an ISBN
    associated so that it can be tracked for sale - even multiple versions.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>PWPs with Shared Resources</h2>
  <p>EsteemedPublisher creates apps to distribute several journals to readers.
    These apps share script libraries, CSS files, and other resources.
    Distributing many journals as a package should enable systems to call the
    shared resources once, speeding up processing and enabling offline reading.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
 <h2>Cross-references</h2>
 <p>Writer Annie writes a dissertation. She references to her Master's
    thesis, published on the university website. Her colleague Bob has
    read her Master's thesis before. When he clicks the reference in
    Annie's dissertation, he gets redirected to his local copy of Annie's
    Master's thesis. Her friend, Charlie, hasn't read her Master's thesis
    before. Charlie needs to be online when clicking the reference, to read
    Annie's Master's thesis. </p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Publication with Static Data</h2>
  <p>Rosa submitted an article to EsteemedJournal and provided her research
    data in CSV format. She and EsteemedJournal wish to provide users access
    to the CSVs when they gain access to her article. EsteemedJournal
    recommends that the package is built in such a way that a system can query
    the manifest to assess whether it is situationally appropriate to offer
    downloads. For example, the package might not offer the option to download
    the CSV while a user is reading offline. </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Publication with Interactive Data</h2>
  <p>(Extension to the Publication with Data use case): the article of Rosa
    not only includes data, but also interactive graphics relying on that
    data, with interaction directed through javascript (or other) programming
    interfaces. These javascript programs may be fairly complex, and may also
    rely on external libraries (not necessarily integrated into the article
    itself). </p>
</section>

</section>
<section>
  <h2>Use Cases - Manifests and Packages</h2>

<section>
  <h2>Streamlined Access to Disjoint Package Components </h2>
  <p>EsteemedJournalPublisher would like to offer the users of the
    EsteemedJournal of Chemistry App the opportunity to read only the abstracts
    of the journals in the app. The App Package must offer the user a list
    (table of contents) of abstracts (disjoint objects in the package with
    semantic information or metadata informing the package of the nature of the
    object). </p>

    <p>(Is the abstract-only view built-in? spun-off using shared resource?
      totally independent publication?)</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Manifest includes Information of New Content</h2>
  <p>Shoshana is an organic chemist. She has purchased the Esteemed Journal of
    Chemistry App. She downloads Organic Chem Quarterly in her lab and reads the
    first article over lunch. Shoshana begins the book reviews during office
    hours but must tend to her students' questions, so she closes the app.
    Shoshana opens the app on the train ride home to resume reading the book
    reviews. She is happy to find that the app opens to the exact location and
    opens quickly because most of the material does not need to be downloaded a
    second time. </p>

  <p>An archival service needs to update an Archival Information Package (i.e.,
    a previously harvested PWP) because a new version of a component of the PWP
    has been published</p>

</section>
<section>
  <h2>Manifest Includes Links to Resources, Regardless of Location</h2>
  <p>An archival service wants to harvest (spider) a PWP, and expects to find
    in the manifest what it will need to make sure it gets all the pieces of
    the PWP that need to be archived, even if on separate servers.</p>
</section>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Use Cases - Archival Interest</h2>
  <section>
    <h2>Integrity and Longevity</h2>
    <p>A government agency (e.g., laws, regulations, judicial decisions) publishes
      information that need to persist without any loss of information
      forever.</p>
    <p>Journal article (e.g. announcing novel compound in chemistry) must be
      published in method that is persistent because it serves at the document of
      record for scientific record.  </p>
  </section>

<section>
  <h2>Retraction Notices</h2>
  <p>An archival service needs to harvest the retraction notice and update the
    Archival Information Package for the original PWP to include / link to the
    Retraction Notice.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Take-down Notices</h2>
  <p>An archival service needs to update an Archival Information Package (i.e.,
    a previously harvested PWP) because it or one of its components has been
    taken down by the publisher.</p>
</section>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Use Cases - Accessibility</h2>
<section>
  <h2>Personalized Experience</h2>
  <p>Alice, a dyslexic student, downloads a textbook and proceeds to
    personalize the material with larger font and different contrast.</p>

  <h2>Supporting User Preferences</h2>
  <p>While reading a book on computer programming, Bob wants to change the
    font into a local font. However, the code should remain in a
    fixed-width font.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Adding Alternative Media</h2>
  <p>As a publisher of accessible content, I need to add content such as a
    braille style sheet, image descriptions, or video captioning (text /
    descriptive audio) to a PWP previously published by a third party.</p>
    <h3>Braille</h3>   
        <p>There is an important difference between just sending the raw text to a braille display which will translate the text to the default braille grade and language the braille display is using and having a pre-formatted braille rendition using a specific braille table.
    </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>As a publisher wanting to fulfill my legal requirements in creating an accessible Math textbook, I wish to include my math equation examples in Braille as well as MathML since not all reading systems fully support MathML.  Nemeth Braille is primarily used so I have added separate preformatted Nemeth Braille examples to my publication in addition to the MathML.</p>
   
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Assisted Reader Technology</h2>
  <p>As a user of assistive technology, Alice wants to perceive the full
    PWP.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Time-based Media</h2>
  <p>Bobbie is learning to read and viewing a picture book. The picture book
    is fixed layout that will turn the page and reads along in sync with the
    page currently open.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Building a Custom PWP</h2>
  <p>Alice wants to download a PWP that captures only the external resources
    she needs to perceive the PWP.</p>
</section>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>CSS Requirements for Packaged Multiple Documents</h2>
<section>
  <h2>Pagination and Generated Content</h2>
  <p>Any kind of pagination and also indexing has to be through a whole
    collection of documents that constitute a PWP, which may raise issues
    around transition between documents.</p>

    <p>As a reader, I want to choose between a scrolled view and a paginated
      view of content that extends across multiple html documents</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Navigation</h2>
  <p>As a publisher I want to navigate from chapter 1 to chapter 2 (separate
    HTML files) seamlessly. The presentation should not be bound to HTML
    organization. This happens, for example, in Japanese publication where
    there are no chapter separations but content is still split between
    multiple files for organizational reasons.</p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>CSS customization</h2>
  <p>As a publisher I want my footnotes to number sequentially across the
    publication, even when the publication is constructed of multiple
    documents.</p>
  <p>Content may have significantly different styles between files. For
    instance, some Japanese books will have documents whose root element
    is vertical-rl and others whose root element is horizontal-tb. These root
    element styles must be preserved.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Transitions</h2>
  <p>Placeholder: Comics-like transition</p>

  <p>Placeholder: Page Transition effects both within an HTML document, and
    between HTML documents</p>
</section>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Use Cases - Other</h2>
<section>
 <h2>Offline Publications</h2>
 <p>Corp.Inc. creates an internal manual for its employees as a PWP. This
    PWP is not published online, but is sent around to all its employees.
    Employee Anna has some questions about figure 2b, and sends an email to
    co-worker Bob with a locator to that figure. Bob clicks on that locator,
    and his company-branded PWP reader opens Bob's personal copy of the
    manual, and redirects immediatly to that figure.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Publication plus Annotations</h2>
  <p>Oksana submits a scholarly article to a EsteemedJournal. EsteemedJournal
    puts the article through the Peer Review process, during which
    EsteemedJounral editors and third-party reviewers provide comments on the
    article. Ultimately, EsteemedJournal chooses not to publish Oksana's
    article, but the comments (annotations) that have already been made should
    persist as she submits it to RespectedJournal. </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Specialized Domain Semantics</h2>
  <p>Placeholder: Formal usage terms and engineering or legal documents,
    possibly for accessibility also.</p>
  <p>Specialized semantics are required for users and processors.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>
Requirement(s)
</h2>
   <p>Be able handle intermittent changes in online/offline status during a
     single reading session while still minimizing the amount of material
     cached locally.</p>

  <p>It SHOULD be possible to describe explicitly which resource does
     and which does not belong to the PWP or, to the “portable” part of
     a PWP.</p>

  <p>There MUST be a separation between a format-independent
     (“canonical”) and format-dependent locator.</p>

  <p>It MUST be possible (and necessary) to use, for all cross-references,
    the canonical locator.</p>

  <p>There MUST be a separation between the identifier (e.g., ISBN) and
    the (canonical) locator of a specific instance of a PWP.</p>

  <p>There SHOULD be a possibility in the PWP to follow (if necessary)
     the copying (provenance) chain<p>

  <p>The Identifier (e.g., ISBN) MAY serve as a canonical locator for a
     specific instance of a PWP</p>

  <p>It SHOULD be possible to use, in all circumstances, a relative
     locator to manipulate, annotate, etc, content in a PWP</p>

  <p>A PWP Processor MUST be able to combine a relative locator with
     the canonical as well as state dependent locators of a PWP</p>

  <p>Locating a resource within a PWP should not depend on the PWP's
     state.</p>

  <p>A state independent locator should be part of the PWP.</p>

  <p>There needs to be persistence of identifiers across PWP instances.</p>

  <p>Any set up and mechanism, handling canonical and state-dependent
    locators, MUST be easily settable on any server (albeit maybe not
    in the most efficient manner) based on basic server behavior
    control.</p>

  <p>There should be the capability for dynamic updating of information
      based on online/offline status and time of publication.</p>

  <p>A PWP must allow for access control and write protections as part of
      the resource.</p>

  <p>Package may contain/point to textual/graphical/media as well as data
    (CSV, code repository)</p>

  <p>Package should include a queryable manifest.</p>

  <p>Package may contain javascript libraries, and possibly other types of
    processing engines, like Java</p>

  <p>Javascript libraries may refer to services "outside", ie, to services on
    the Web at large (e.g., reference to Wolfram Alfa, or online google
    services)</p>

  <p>Javascript libraries may become relatively complex and may therefore be
    packaged; this means that the packaging format should allow for other
    packages as parts.</p>

  <p>Content in package is fully annotatable</p>

  <p>Annotations are considered part of the package</p>

  <p>There needs to be metadata on package components</p>

  <p>Manifest with metadata and semantic information</p>

  <p>Customizable manifest functionality</p>

  <p>Manifest indicates whether content is new (relative to last download) and
    triggers download only when content is new/updated.</p>

  <p>There should be a discovery service or trigger available to indicate
    content changes or long-term availability changes.</p>

  <p>The complex collection of documents, media, and other resources that
    comprise a publication must remain intact and complete across all
    transitions (online/offline), rendering in various formats, and
    distribution over time.</p>

  <p>Data that affects content may be stored apart from the content.</p>

  <p>The choice should be driven by content or workflow, not mandated by
    specification.</p>

  <p>Long-form content should not be stored in one giant file. This affects
    performance, storage, workflow.</p>

  <p>The components of a publication should be aggregated or disaggregated
    without loss of information.</p>

  <p>Every resource can hold it’s own rights. The rights of this resource
    should be kept in the process of distributing the resource.</p>

  <p>A collection of documents must be treated as a single unit for:
    Searching, values of counters (page counters, section numbering, footnotes),
    and user stylesheets (users must be able to adjust display, e.g., font
    selection, font-size adjustment, background color)</p>

  <p>PWP needs to support rendering for visual output, tactile output, and
    audio output.</p>

  <p>Package needs to support Time based media and Text such as audio
    synchronized with text, Video synchronized with Text, sign language sync
    with text.</p>
