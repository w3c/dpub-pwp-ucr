        Publications, from corporate memos to newsletters to electronic books to scholarly journal articles, must be
        considered first-class content on the Web, equal to the more common forms of Web pages available today. This
        document describes the various use cases highlighting the problems users and publishers face when these
        publications are to be used in a digital, Web environment. The requirements that come from those use cases
        provide the basis for the technical considerations in a companion document, currently entitled “Web
        Publications”&nbsp;[[wpub]].

        This is work in progress. The final version of this document is planned to be published as a Working Group Note.
      </p>
      <p>
        A previous version of this document was published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG">Digital Publishing
        Interest Group</a> as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-pwp-ucr-20170502/">Interest Group Note</a>.
        After the closure of that Interest Group the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Publishing
        Working Group</a> took it over for further work.

    <section id="introduction">
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely joined by hyperlinks. Clustering within
        domains and with explicit navigation elements built into them, webpages evolved into websites. Despite the
        Web's strong connections to print media (e.g. web resources are “pages” and the in-memory model for Web
        applications is the “Document Object Model”), this document argues that the web platform may still not be
        meeting certain requirements from print media that users desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over centuries, “books” have assumed many forms: journals, magazines, pamphlets of long-form articles and
        essays, newspapers, atlases, comics, notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different
        manifestations as “publications”: bound editions of meaningful media, made public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another form of publication that also has a long history in both the printed as well as the digital world are
        documents. These are publications that are written and distributed in a more ad-hoc manner, such as legal
        briefs, corporate memos, and even the definitions of standards, such as this content currently being read.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe there is great value in combining this older tradition of portable, bounded publications with the
        pervasive accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform (OWP). New models of
        economic sustainability and innovative experiences of knowledge depend on this.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the task of the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a> to
        explore the uniqueness, desirability, and feasibility of bringing these two great models of publishing
        together. This document explores requirements based on examples of real world use cases and scenarios.
        Requirements for publications on the Web are explored first, without referring to any packaging aspect that
        would correspond to current practices like EPUB. This is followed by requirements of those packaging aspects,
        as a structure on top of a purely Web based distribution. The complete list of requirements is also collected
        in a separate table in <a href="#req_list"></a>.

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <ul class="terms">
          <li>
            This document uses the term <dfn>user agent</dfn>, as used by the Web community; see, for example, the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Definition_of_User_Agent">WAI glossary entry</a>. The
            publishing community often uses the term “reading system” for roughly the same notion; while there may be
            subtle differences, it is better to stick to a single term for the purposes of this document.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <dfn>Web Publication</dfn> (WP) is a collection of one or more constituent resources, organized together
            in a uniquely identifiable grouping, and presented using standard Open Web Platform technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <dfn>Packaged Web Publication</dfn> (PWP) is a <a>Web Publication</a> whose constituent resources are
            combined into a single distributable file, using some standard packaging format.
          </li>
          <li>
            In this document, <dfn>manifest</dfn> refers to an abstract means to contain information necessary to the
            proper management, rendering, and so on, of a publication. This is opposed to metadata that contains
            information on the content of the publication like author, publication date, and so on. The precise format
            of how such a manifest is stored is not considered in this document.

            Web Publications should be able to make use of all features offered by the Open Web Platform (OWP).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a remarkable development of tools and frameworks built on top of OWP that make it possible to
            develop powerful interactive layers on top of OWP. These include, for example, data visualization systems
            (e.g., d3, built on top of SVG), possibilities to access external services like Wolfram Alpha, or tools to
            create and store (possibly as part of the publication) annotations. These tools have been traditionally
            developed around browsers, and provide possibilities that publications should also benefit from. That
            requires that <a data-lt="Web Publication">Web Publications</a> become first class citizens on the Web
            platform.
          </p>
          <ul class="use-cases">
            <li id="jrnl">
              A large, multidisciplinary, Web-based journal relies on traditional Web technologies like HTML and CSS for
              its content. The journal, responding to the evolving expectations of its audience, is increasingly using
              additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics, and very large images; the trend is to consider
              these as integral parts of the scientific output. The journal as a result needs access to the latest
              visualization and other data management tools that the OWP-based tools can offer.
            </li>
            <li id="edu">
              Educational publications are increasingly making use of OWP features. In addition to video, audio, and animations, they may also include interactive exams
              (possibly linked to online evaluation facilities), visualization of data or of algorithms, and built-in
              interpreters for various languages (e.g., for courses on programming). In many respects, the borderline
              between these publications and Web applications is becoming fuzzy.
            </li>
            <li id="in_house_doc">
              BigBoxCo, a large technology company with extensive “in-house” documentation to support  technical and administrative processes
              and user documentation for their various products, develops all this
              material in digital-only formats. The quantity of documentation makes it impractical to produce these
              documents in print. Instead, the company publishes them on the company intranet, and/or provides them to
              their employees and contractors via specialized mobile applications. These documents, as a type of
              publication, require accessibility, portability of annotations, and the possible inclusion of complex
              media.

          <h3>Horizontal Dependencies</h3>
          <p class="req-set" id="r_horizdep">
            A Web Publication should conform to the requirements of all horizontal dependencies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web content has to be consumed under different circumstances: it must be available to the largest possible
            audience in a secure manner, providing the necessary protection of the reader’s privacy. Publication content
            must be able to answer to a number of principles like accessibility, internationalization, device
            independence, security, and privacy. (These are usually referred to, in the W3C context, as “horizontal”
            dependencies.) These principles are, in general terms:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Accessibility:</dt>
            <dd>
              People with disabilities should be able to access the content of a publication. They should be able to
              perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well as contribute to it. Accessibility
              encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the content, including visual, auditory, physical,
              speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.
            </dd>
            <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
            <dd>
              Publications should be well adapted to any language, writing systems, region, or culture. This includes
              the usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left, horizontal or vertical writing; item
              numbering, or interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of the right character sets and of
              local typographic conventions.
            </dd>
            <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
            <dd>
              The content in a publication should be usable on a large number of devices with very different device
              characteristics: different screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying level of processing
              power, etc. These different affordances should be automatic with no, or very little, user intervention.
            </dd>
            <dt>Security:</dt>
            <dd>
              Publications should be presented by a User Agent using a security model that is at least (if not more)
              secure than the standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/runtime/">Web security model</a>. Doing this will
              prevent publications that contain malicious attacks, data theft, and other security incidents from
              impacting users by jeopardizing the integrity of the underlying data or machine operations.
            </dd>
            <dt>Privacy:</dt>
            <dd>
              The content in a publication should maintain and support user privacy, in spite of the fact that the
              evolution of online technologies has increased the possibility for the collection and processing of
              personal, and possibly sensitive, data. However, since a publication may use <a href="#r_owp">any part
              of the OWP</a>, it may choose to use  functionality such as the ability to track a user's activity
              within the publication.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <p>
            These principles correspond to technical requirements on the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its
            possible extension to Web Publications) insofar as the technologies must empower the authors (writers,
            editors, publishers, etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether authors use the possibilities of
            these technologies or not is not addressed in this document.
          </p>
          <p>
            All these constraints are formalized in the context of the usage on the Web and by extension Web
            Publications. This means that they are valid for publications in general. In some cases, for example due to
            legislative reasons, the demands on publications may be more stringent than for generic Web sites. The use
            cases below provide some examples for the publication-specific situations. Note also that some aspect of
            horizontal dependencies (e.g., accessibility or security), are also the subject of further use cases and
            requirements elsewhere in this document.

              determine which titles are accessible and therefore suitable for his use. This can be done because the
              publishers have added the <a href="https://idpf.github.io/a11y-guidelines/content/meta/schema.org.html">Schema.org Accessibility Metadata</a>
              to the Web Publication, describing the accessbility characteristics for each constituent resource.

          <p class="req-set" id="r_con-res">
            The information regarding the constituent resources of a Web Publication must be easily discovered and there
            should be a way to differentiate between essential and non-essential resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Web Publication will likely be composed of multiple Web documents and their resources. A more complicated
            Web Publication may have many resources, some of which are essential and some of which are not. Because of
            this complexity, extracting in advance all the references to some or all constituent resources may be
            prohibitive. It is therefore necessary for the user agent to have an easy access to the list of constituent
            resources and some of their characteristics such as whether they are essential, their media types, or their
            sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a publication, some content is essential to the user being able to consume it while other content could
            be either absent or have a provided fallback for situations such as limited connectivity or storage. This
            information, provided by the author or publisher of the Web Publication, would enable a user agent to
            provide a better experience to the user. For example, the user agent can ensure that essential resources are
            made available when offline (see <a href="#onloffl"></a>).

              images, sounds, and multimedia files. Nick also rides the subway, where he loses Internet connectivity
              frequently and without warning for long stretches of time. During offline or low-storage situations, there
              are still critical parts of the publication that are consumable, mainly the text (and possibly images).
              Having a reasonable fallback for video, such as a poster image or placeholder image, would allow Nick to
              read the content while offline or on a device with limited storage.

              anonymized log files, is also available. Because of its size, the researchers have marked the dataset as
              non-essential for conveying the results of the paper and therefore indicates it can be skipped when
              reading the publication offline.

              one week later and opens the stock exchange publication, she will continue to see the value of the stock
              as it was the last time she opened the publication. It should be possible for either the content itself or
              the user agent to provide some user experience that notifies her that the currently presented data is a
              week old.

          <h3>Archiving</h3>
          <p>
            We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of which have survived with little more
            than benign neglect. In contrast, digital documents are unlikely to persist without more active interventions,
            such as making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating integrity. Since future consumers of
            publications represent the most open-ended user group, it is desirable that digital documents be instilled
            with more of the inherent durability that characterizes print artifacts. Packaged Web Publications offer this
            potential, by making it easier for archiving services to locate, harvest, update, and describe digital
            publications. Long-term preservation of digital publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible,
            beyond the tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fundamental use cases and requirements already help aid our archiving requirements. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a class="req-ref-full" href="#r_con-res"></a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, archival raises an additional requirements:
          </p>

          <p class="req-set" id="r_archmetadata">
            There should be a way to indicate whether one or more Packaged Web Publication components contain (embedded)
            descriptive metadata.
          </p>
          <p>
            An archiving service needs a reliable way to determine which, if any, Web Publication components contain
            descriptive metadata, such as that described in <a href="#manifest-metadata">metadata and resources</a>.
            Without such a mechanism, the archiving service will have to develop and maintain publisher- and/or
            platform-specific heuristics for locating or parsing out descriptive metadata, making archiving more
            expensive and decreasing the reliability of reporting.
          </p>
          <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>
              An archiving service sets out to conduct an initial harvest of an article. Along with the images, markup,
              scripts, and style and layout instructions that constitute the object, it is able to locate a file
              containing descriptive metadata. The archiving service retrieves these resources and packages them into a
              logical archival unit for ingest into a preservation repository. A related process identifies and parses
              the descriptive metadata and saves its contents into an associated management database.

            An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn that one or more Packaged Web Publication components have

            archive of the publication.

          <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>
              An archiving service regularly polls for changes to an article that it has already archived. One such poll
              indicates that several resources have been added to the object. The archiving service retrieves these
              resources and store them as incremental updates to the appropriate archival unit in a preservation
              repository.
            </li>
            <li>
              A publisher issues a retraction for a published article, resulting in the addition of new resources to the
              object (i.e., the retraction notice) and the removal of others (i.e., the article content). An archiving
              service regularly polls for changes to this article, which it has already archived, and discovers the
              retraction. The archiving service retrieves the new resources and record those that are no longer
              accessible, carrying over the cumulative updates to a preservation repository.
            </li>
            <li>
              A copyright dispute results in the takedown of a published book. An archiving service regularly polls for
              changes to this book, which it has already archived, and discovers that it has been taken down. It records
              that the resources that constitute the object are no longer accessible and propagates this update to a
              preservation repository.

          A manifest may be a file in some predefined format, such as XML or JSON or it could simply be some data in a

            Gyöngyi, selected as a peer reviewer for the Journal of Scholarly Publications, only has time to review
            her assigned publication while commuting on the train to her university, where she does not have
            connectivity. Since her review process includes the creation of annotations, notes, highlights, and
            possibly changes on the content itself, it is important that these changes must be smoothly transferred
            back to the server of the journal when she is back online.
