        Publications, from newletters to electronic books to scholarly journal
        articles, must be considered first-class content on the web, equal to
        the more common forms of web pages available today. This documents
        describes the various use cases highlighting the problems users and
        publishers face when traditional publications are to be used in a
        digital, Web environment. The requirements that come from those use
        cases provide the basis for the technical considerations a companion

    <section id="introduction">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely
          joined by hyperlinks. Clustering within domains and with explicit
          navigation elements built into them, webpages evolved into websites.
          This model inherited very little from an existing, powerful
          and much older page-based media: books.</p>

        <p>Over centuries, “books” have assumed many forms: journals, magazines,
          pamphlets of long-form articles and essays, newspapers, atlases, comics,
          notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different
          manifestations as “publications”: bound editions of meaningful media,
          made public.</p>

        <p>Another form of publication that also has a long history in both the
        printed as well as the digital world are documents. These are
        publications that are written and distributed in a more ad-hoc manner,
        such as legal briefs, corporate memos, and even the definitions of
        standards, such as this content currently being read.</p>

        <p>We believe there is great value in combining this older tradition
          of portable, bounded publications with the pervasive accessibility,
          addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform (OWP). New
          models of economic sustainability, innovative experiences of knowledge
          and invigorated socio-cultural engagement depend on this.</p>

        <p>It is the task of this W3C Digital Publishing Interest Group to
          explore the uniqueness, desirability, and feasibility of bringing
          these two great models of publishing together. This document explores
          requirements based on examples of real world use cases and scenarios.
          The fundamental, baseline requirements that form the heart of what is
          expected from a web publication are described first, followed by requirements and
          use cases that describe additional, strongly desired scenarios.
          The complete list of requirements is also collected in a separate table in
          <a href="#req_list"></a>.</p>

          <h2>Terminology</h2>
          <ul class="terms">
              <!-- <li>Online/Offline: The terms “online” and “offline” are used in this document, but the
              borderline between these is not always clear cut. For example, a web publication
              can be on a local disc but accessed through a web server running on
              that machine (i.e., through a <code>http://localhost</code> URL).
              The behavior of the client in this case is identical to the situation when the
              publication is genuinely online, although, technically, the
              publication is clearly offline. Similarly, a remote file system can be
              mounted as a local disc, in which case a web publication can be accessed as a file
              though technically online. A more precise terminology would use the
              terms like “protocol” and “file” states, for what is colloquially
              called “online” and “offline” in this document.</li> -->

              <li>This document uses the term <dfn>user agent</dfn>, as used by the Web
              community; see, for example, the <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Definition_of_User_Agent">WAI
              glossary entry</a>. The publishing community often uses the term
              “reading system” for roughly the same notion; while there may be
              subtle differences, it has been decided that it is better to stick
              to a single term for the purposes of this document.</li>

			  <li>A <dfn>Web Publication</dfn> (WP) is a collection of one or more Web resources,
			  organized together in a uniquely identifiable grouping, and presented using
			  standard Open Web Platform formats.</li>

              <li>A <dfn>Packaged Web Publication</dfn> (PWP) is a <a>Web Publication</a> whose
                  constituent resources are packed into a single distributable file, using some standard packaging format.</li>

              <p>In this document, <dfn>manifest</dfn> refers to an abstract way,
              typically through one or several files, that contain information necessary to the
              proper management, rendering, and so on, of a publication. This is opposed to metadata that contains information on the content of the publication like author, publication date, and so on. The precise format of such a manifest is not considered in this document.</p>

        <h1>Web Publications</h1>
        <p>This section describes the use cases specific to <a data-lt="Web Publication">Web Publications</a> and the Open Web Platform, including associated publishing
        needs, and discoverability.</p>

        <section id='pwp-owp'>
            <h2>Open Web Platform</h2>
            <p class="req-set" id="r_owp">Web Publications should be able to make use of all
            features offered by the OWP.</p>

            <p>There is a remarkable development of tools and frameworks built
            on top of OWP that make it possible to develop powerful interactive
            layers on top of OWP. These include, for example, data visualization
            systems (e.g., d3, built on top of SVG), possibilities to access
            external services like Wolfram Alfa, or tools to create and store (possibly as part of the publication) annotations. These tools have been
            traditionally developed around browsers, and provide possibilities that
            traditional publications should also benefit from. That requires that <a data-lt="Web Publication">Web Publications</a> become first class citizens on the Web platform.</p>

            <ul class="use-cases">
                <li>A large, multidisciplinary, web-based journal relies on
                traditional web technologies like HTML and CSS for its
                content. The journal, responding to the evolving
                expectations of its audience, is increasingly using
                additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics,
                and very large images; the trend is to consider these as
                integral parts of the scientific output. The journal as a
                result needs access to the latest visualization and other
                data management tools that the OWP-based tools can
                offer.</li>

                <li>Educational publications are increasingly making use of OWP
                features. They include interactive exams (possibly linked to
                online evaluation facilities), visualization of data or of
                algorithms, built-in interpreters for various languages (e.g.,
                for courses on programming); in many respects, the borderline
                between these publications and web applications is becoming
                fuzzy.</li>

                <li id="in_house_doc">BigBoxCo, a large technology company
                with extensive "in-house" documentation to support the
                technical and/or user documentation for their various
                products and administrative processes, develops all this
                material in digital-only formats. The quantity of
                documentation makes it impractical to produce these documents
                in print. Instead, the company publishes them
                on the company intranet, and/or provides them to their
                employees and contractors via specialized mobile devices.
                These documents, as a type of publication, require
                accessibility, portability of annotations, and
                the possible inclusion of complex media.</li>
            </ul>

            <section id="multimedia">
                <h3>Alternative modalities</h3>
                <p class="req-set" id="r_multimedia">The notion of a Web Publication should
                enable specific publications like audio books, graphics books, and
                mixed media.</p>

                <p>All concepts and structures related to a <a>Web Publication</a> should
                enable the creation and/or production of alternative
                renderings for visual and auditory content.</p>

                <ul class ="use-cases">
                  <li>Faye, a busy mother of five, wants to access audio books while commuting, jogging, doing dishes, or otherwise not able to use her eyes or hands. </li>

                  <li>Khoudia, a librarian focusing on the children's section of her local library, is looking exclusively for material rich in audio and video components so as to reach a wider age bracket.</li>

                  <li>As Nemeth Braille is commonly used as a means to access math tactually in education, BigBox Publisher has added Nemeth Braille examples to its publication, in addition to the MathML content.</li>

                  <li>James, a musician, requires that the musical score within a publication come preformatted in braille music notation in order to read it, as he uses freely available assistive technology which does not have braille music translations built in.</li>

                  <li>A class of students is reading a book in which poems are pictorially presented in different shapes. To have a comparable experience as her sighted classmates, Lisa, who is visually impaired, needs access to the material in braille. Because of the way the poems are presented, she actually needs the content in preformatted braille that provides an equivalent precision. </li>

                  <li>Working with colleagues on some research issues Joos, who is visually impaired, needs an alternative access for the various articles the research work is based on. He chooses an audio rendition of the article content, because he does not master braille well enough. </li>

                  <li>BigBox Publisher needs to add content such as a braille style sheet, image descriptions, or video captioning (text/descriptive audio) to a web publication.</li>

                <h3>Horizontal Dependencies</h3>
                <p class="req-set" id="r_horizdep">The Web Publication should conform to
                all the requirements of horizontal dependencies.</p>

                <p>Web content has to be consumed under different
                circumstances: it must be available to the largest
                possible audience in a secure manner, providing the
                necessary protection of the reader’s privacy. Publication
                content must be able to answer to a number of principles
                like accessibility, internationalization, device
                independence, security, and privacy. (These are usually
                referred to, in the W3C context, as “horizontal”
                dependencies.) These principles are, in general terms:
                </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Accessibility:</dt>
                    <dd>People with disabilities should be able to access
                      the content of a publication. They should be able to perceive,
                      understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well
                      as contribute to it. Accessibility encompasses all
                      disabilities that affect access to the content,
                      including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive,
                      and neurological disabilities.</dd>

                    <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
                    <dd>Publications should be well adapted to any language,
                      writing systems, region, or culture. This includes the
                      usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left,
                      horizontal or vertical writing; item numbering, or
                      interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of
                      the right character sets and of local typographic conventions.</dd>

                    <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
                    <dd>The content in a publication should be usable on a large number of devices
                      with very different device characteristics: different
                      screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying
                      level of processing power, etc. These different affordances
                      should be automatic with no, or very little, user intervention.</dd>

                    <dt>Security:</dt>
                    <dd>Publications should be presented by a User Agent using a security model that is at least (if not more) secure than the standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/runtime/">web security model</a>. Doing will prevent publications that contain malicious attacks,
                    data theft, and other security incidents from impacting users by jeopardizing the integrity of the underlying data or machine operations.</dd>

                    <dt>Privacy:</dt>
                    <dd>The content in a publication should maintain and support user privacy,
                      in spite of the fact that the evolution of online
                      technologies has increased the possibility for the
                      collection and processing of personal, and possibly
                      sensitive, data. However, since a publication may use <a href="#pwp-owp">any part of the OWP</a>, it may choose to use  functionality such as the ability to
                      track a user's activity within the publication.</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>These principles correspond to technical requirements on
                  the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its possible
                  extension for the web publication) insofar as the technologies must
                  empower the authors (writers, editors, publishers,
                  etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether
                  authors use the possibilities of these technologies or
                  not is not addressed in this document.</p>

                <p>All these constraints are formalized in the
                  context of the usage on the Web and by extension Web Publications.
                  This means that they are valid
                  for publications in general regardless of whether
                  they are online or offline, or whether the publication
                  is distributed as a single unit or not.
                  In some cases, for example due to legislative reasons,
                  the demands on publications may be more stringent
                  than for generic web sites. The use cases below provide
                  some examples for the publication-specific situations.

            <h3>Constituent Resources</h3>

            <p class="req-set" id="r_con-res">The information regarding the
              constituent resources of a Web Publication must be easily discovered
              and there should be a way to differentiate between essential and
              non-essential resources.</p>

            <p>A Web Publication will likely be composed of multiple Web documents and their
              resources. A more complicated Web Publication may have many resources, some of
              which are essential and some of which are not. Because of this
              complexity, extracting in advance all the references to some or all
              constituent resources may be prohibitive. It is therefore necessary
              for the user agent to have an easy access to the list of constituent
              resources and some of their characteristics such as whether they are
              essential, and their media types and sizes. </p>

           <p>In a publication, some content is essential to the user being
              able to consume it while other content could be either absent or
              have a provided fallback for situations such as limited connectivity
              or storage. This information, provided by the author or publisher of
              the Web Publication, would enable a user agent to provide a better
              experience to the user. For exanple, the user agent can ensure that
              essential resources are made available when offline (see <a
              href="#fundamental-online-offline"></a>.</p>

                Nick also rides the subway, where
                he loses Internet connectivity frequently and without
                warning for long stretches of time. During offline or
                low-storage situations, there are still critical parts of the
                publication that are consumable, mainly the text (and
                possibly images). Having a reasonable fallback for video,
                such as a poster image or placeholder image, would allow Nick
                to read the content while offline or on a device with
                limited storage.

                and opens the stock exchange publication, she will continue to see the value of the
                stock as it was the last time she opened the
                publication. It should be possible for either the content itself or the user agent to
                provide some user experience that notifies her that the currently presented data is a

                cannot be included in a packaged publication and the interactive module is
                of no use without such data. Risha therefore marks the web publication component
                relative to the interactive module as not relevant when offline. </li>

         <h1>Archiving</h1>

         <p>We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of
         which have survived with little more than benign neglect. In contrast, digital
         documents are unlikely to persist without more active interventions, such as
         making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating integrity.
         Since future consumers of publications represent the most open-ended user
         group, it is desirable that digital documents be instilled with more of the
         inherent durability that characterizes print artifacts. Packaged Web Publication offers this
         potential, by making it easier for archiving services to locate, harvest,
         update, and describe digital publications. Long-term preservation of digital
         publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible, beyond the
         tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing
         platforms.</p>

         <p>Some fundamental use cases and requirements already help aid our archiving requirements.

                 <li>An archiving service regularly polls for changes to an article that it
                 has already archived. One such poll indicates that several resources have
                 been added to the object. The archiving service retrieves these resources
                 and store them as incremental updates to the appropriate archival unit in
                 a preservation repository.</li>

                 <li>A publisher issues a retraction for a published article, resulting in
                 the addition of new resources to the object (i.e., the retraction notice)
                 and the removal of others (i.e., the article content). An archiving
                 service regularly polls for changes to this article, which it has already
                 archived, and discovers the retraction. The archiving service retrieves
                 the new resources and record those that are no longer accessible, carrying

                 already archived, and discovers that it has been taken down. It records
                 that the resources that constitute the object are no longer accessible and
                 propagates this update to a preservation repository.</li>

        <p>The fundamental requirement on identification already states that there

        resources within a publication, such as a chapter, an image, or a
        mathematical formula. While the Web provides a model for this for non-packaged resources,
        a model that will work for the packaged version is also necessary.</p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>A scholarly mathematical publication refers to a specific theorem
            in another publication, and that reference must be unique, stable and

            the publishes issues a new version of the target publication (thereby
            possibly change the section numbering).</li>

            <li>An archival service wants to harvest (spider) a Web Publication and not have to modify the OWP content during the process. In order to achive that goal, there manifest would incorporate a mapping from the URIs present in the OWP content to their new location inside the archive.</li>

               read the Web Publication on the Web because the
