        Publications, from corporate memos to newsletters to electronic books to scholarly journal articles, must be
        considered first-class content on the Web, equal to the more common forms of Web pages available today. This
        document describes the various use cases highlighting the problems users and publishers face when these
        publications are to be used in a digital, Web environment. The requirements that come from those use cases
        provide the basis for the technical considerations in a companion document, currently entitled “Web

        A previous version of this document was published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG">Digital Publishing
        Interest Group</a> as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-pwp-ucr-20170502/">Interest Group Note</a>.

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Web emerged in 1994, based on a model of individual pages loosely joined by hyperlinks. Clustering within
        domains and with explicit navigation elements built into them, webpages evolved into websites. Despite the
        Web's strong connections to print media (e.g. web resources are “pages” and the in-memory model for Web
        applications is the “Document Object Model”), this document argues that the web platform may still not be
        meeting certain requirements from print media that users desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over centuries, “books” have assumed many forms: journals, magazines, pamphlets of long-form articles and
        essays, newspapers, atlases, comics, notebooks, albums of all sorts. We can define these different
        manifestations as “publications”: bound editions of meaningful media, made public.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another form of publication that also has a long history in both the printed as well as the digital world are
        documents. These are publications that are written and distributed in a more ad-hoc manner, such as legal
        briefs, corporate memos, and even the definitions of standards, such as this content currently being read.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe there is great value in combining this older tradition of portable, bounded publications with the
        pervasive accessibility, addressability, and interconnectedness of the Open Web Platform (OWP). New models of
        economic sustainability and innovative experiences of knowledge depend on this.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the task of the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/dpub/IG/">Digital Publishing Interest Group</a> to
        explore the uniqueness, desirability, and feasibility of bringing these two great models of publishing
        together. This document explores requirements based on examples of real world use cases and scenarios.
        Requirements for publications on the Web are explored first, without referring to any packaging aspect that
        would correspond to current practices like EPUB. This is followed by requirements of those packaging aspects,
        as a structure on top of a purely Web-based distribution. The complete list of requirements is also collected
        in <a href="#reqtable">a separate table</a> in an appendix.

        <h3>Terminology</h3>
        <ul class="terms">
          <li>
            This document uses the term <dfn>user agent</dfn>, as used by the Web community; see, for example, the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/work/wiki/Definition_of_User_Agent">WAI glossary entry</a>. The
            publishing community often uses the term “reading system” for roughly the same notion; while there may be
            subtle differences, it is better to stick to a single term for the purposes of this document.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <dfn>Web Publication</dfn> (WP) is a collection of one or more constituent resources, organized together
            in a uniquely identifiable grouping, and presented using standard Open Web Platform technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <dfn>Packaged Web Publication</dfn> (PWP) is a <a>Web Publication</a> whose constituent resources are
            combined into a single distributable file, using some standard packaging format.
          </li>
          <li>
            In this document, <dfn>manifest</dfn> refers to an abstract means to contain information necessary to the
            proper management, rendering, and so on, of a publication. This is opposed to metadata that contains
            information on the content of the publication like author, publication date, and so on. The precise format
            of how such a manifest is stored is not considered in this document.

        <h3>Open Web Platform</h3>
        <p id="r_owp" class="req-set cc-minimal">
          Web Publications should be able to make use of all features offered by the Open Web Platform (OWP).
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a remarkable development of tools and frameworks built on top of OWP that make it possible to
          develop powerful interactive layers on top of OWP. These include, for example, data visualization systems
          (e.g., d3, built on top of SVG), possibilities to access external services like Wolfram Alpha, or tools to
          create and store (possibly as part of the publication) annotations. These tools have been traditionally
          developed around browsers and provide possibilities that publications should also benefit from. That
          requires that <a data-lt="Web Publication">Web Publications</a> become first class citizens on the Web
          platform.
        </p>
        <ul class="use-cases">
          <li id="uc_owp_tools">
            A large, multidisciplinary, Web-based journal relies on traditional Web technologies like HTML and CSS for
            its content. The journal, responding to the evolving expectations of its audience, is increasingly using
            additional media such as video, audio, animated graphics, and very large images; the trend is to consider
            these as integral parts of the scientific output. The journal as a result needs access to the latest
            visualization and other data management tools that the OWP-based tools can offer.
          </li>
          <li id="uc_owp_lms">
            Educational publications are increasingly making use of OWP features. In addition to video, audio, and
            animations, they may also include interactive exams (possibly linked to online evaluation facilities),
            visualization of data or of algorithms, and built-in interpreters for various languages (e.g., for courses
            on programming). In many respects, the borderline between these publications and Web applications is
            becoming fuzzy.
          </li>
          <li id="uc_owp_in_house">
            A large technology company with extensive “in-house” documentation to support technical and administrative
            processes and user documentation for their various products, develops all this material in digital-only
            formats. The quantity of documentation makes it impractical to produce these documents in print. Instead,
            the company publishes them on the company intranet, and/or provides them to their employees and contractors
            via specialized mobile applications. These documents, as a type of publication, require accessibility,
            portability of annotations, and the possible inclusion of complex media.
          </li>
          <li id="uc_owp_news">
            News outlets often rely on video, audio, large images, and interactive elements to enhance their content.
            Web Publications would allow news outlets to provide this content in a unique, identifiable format that can
            facilitate archiving and offline access.
          </li>
          <li id="uc_owp_comics">
            Image-based narrative content like comics, manga, and graphic novels relies heavily on support for large
            images. This type of content may also experiment with interactivity and unique forms of navigation.

        <h3>Horizontal Dependencies</h3>
        <p id="r_horizdep" class="req-set cc-minimal">
          A Web Publication should conform to the requirements of all horizontal dependencies: accessibility,
          internationalization, device independence, security, and privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web content has to be consumed under different circumstances: it must be available to the largest possible
          audience in a secure manner, providing the necessary protection of the reader’s privacy. Publication content
          must be able to answer to a number of principles like accessibility, internationalization, device
          independence, security, and privacy. (These are usually referred to, in the W3C context, as “horizontal”
          dependencies.) These principles are, in general terms:
        </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Accessibility:</dt>
          <dd>
            People with disabilities should be able to access the content of a publication. They should be able to
            perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well as contribute to it. Accessibility
            encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the content, including visual, auditory, physical,
            speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.
          </dd>
          <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
          <dd>
            Publications should be well adapted to any language, writing systems, region, or culture. This includes
            the usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left, horizontal or vertical writing; item
            numbering, or interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of the right character sets and of
            local typographic conventions.
          </dd>
          <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
          <dd>
            The content in a publication should be usable on a large number of devices with very different device
            characteristics: different screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying level of processing
            power, etc. These different affordances should be automatic with no, or very little, user intervention.
          </dd>
          <dt>Security:</dt>
          <dd>
            Publications should be presented by a User Agent using a security model that is at least (if not more)
            secure than the standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/runtime/">Web security model</a>. Doing this will
            prevent publications that contain malicious attacks, data theft, and other security incidents from
            impacting users by jeopardizing the integrity of the underlying data or machine operations.
          </dd>
          <dt>Privacy:</dt>
          <dd>
            The content in a publication should maintain and support user privacy, in spite of the fact that the
            evolution of online technologies has increased the possibility for the collection and processing of personal,
            and possibly sensitive, data. However, since a publication may use <a href="#r_owp">any part of the OWP</a>,
            it may choose to use functionality such as the ability to track a user's activity within the publication.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          These principles correspond to technical requirements on the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its
          possible extension to Web Publications) insofar as the technologies must empower the authors (writers,
          editors, publishers, etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether authors use the possibilities of
          these technologies or not is not addressed in this document.
        </p>
        <p>
          All these constraints are formalized in the context of the usage on the Web and by extension Web
          Publications. This means that they are valid for publications in general. In some cases, for example due to
          legislative reasons, the demands on publications may be more stringent than for generic Web sites. The use
          cases below provide some examples for the publication-specific situations. Note also that some aspect of
          horizontal dependencies (e.g., accessibility or security), are also the subject of further use cases and
          requirements elsewhere in this document.

          Some publications may require additional capabilities (for example, access to camera or geolocation) that a

          be a way to map this unique identification onto a Web Address. The Web Publication must be
          identifiable as a single logical resource
          with its own URL beyond the references to its constituent
          resources.

        <h3>Resources</h3>
        <p id="r_const-res" class="req-set">
          The information regarding the constituent resources of a Web Publication must be easily discovered and there
          should be a way to differentiate between essential and non-essential resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Web Publication will likely be composed of multiple Web documents and their resources. A more complicated
          Web Publication may have many resources, some of which are essential and some of which are not. Because of
          this complexity, extracting in advance all the references to some or all constituent resources may be
          prohibitive. It is therefore necessary for the user agent to have an easy access to the list of constituent
          resources and some of their characteristics, such as media type, size, and whether they are essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a publication, some content is essential to the user being able to consume it while other content could
          be either absent or have a provided fallback for situations such as limited connectivity or storage. This
          information, provided by the author or publisher of the Web Publication, would enable a user agent to provide
          a better experience to the user. For example, the user agent can ensure that essential resources are made
          available when offline (see <a href="#offline"></a>).
        </p>
        <ul class="use-cases">
          <li id="uc_const-res_fallback">
            Nick is reading a long-form narrative on a device with limited storage: a publication filled with text,
            images, audio, and multimedia files. Nick also rides the subway where he loses Internet connectivity
            frequently and without warning for long stretches of time. During offline or low-storage situations, there
            are still critical parts of the publication that are consumable, mainly the text (and possibly images).
            Having a reasonable fallback for video, such as a poster image or placeholder image, would allow Nick to
            read the content while offline or on a device with limited storage.

            descriptions and video when there is good internet connectivity, and fall-back images along with accessible
            descriptions when internet connectivity is not optimum.

            anonymized log files, is also available. Because of its size, the researchers have marked the dataset as

            one week later and opens the stock exchange publication, she will continue to see the value of the stock as
            it was the last time she opened the publication. It should be possible for either the content itself or the

            included in a packaged publication and the interactive module is of no use without such data. Risha
            therefore marks the Web Publication component relative to the interactive module as not essential when

          It should be possible to see the Web Publication in a “paginated” view. When a user agent renders a Web
          Publication in a paginated layout, it must lay out each document in the default reading order sequentially,
          with the last page of a resource being followed by the first page of the subsequent one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas a “scrolling” view is the dominating approach on the Web in browsers, a user or author may wish to
          view their publications in a paginated view. As such, it should be possible for an individual publication or
          user agent to provide the ability to switch to pagination view. This pagination may automatically adapt page
          sizes to the device’s or the browser’s viewport and may contain separate headers, footers, and/or page
          numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is distinct from the need to retain original page numbering (often from the print edition) which must be
          available on demand and must be usable to discover specific locations in the publication.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Archiving</h3>

        <p>
          We take for granted the relative durability of print artifacts, many of which have survived with little more
          than benign neglect. In contrast, digital documents are unlikely to persist without more active interventions,
          such as making copies, monitoring software dependencies, and validating integrity. Since future consumers of
          publications represent the most open-ended user group, it is desirable that digital documents be instilled
          with more of the inherent durability that characterizes print artifacts. Packaged Web Publications offer this
          potential by making it easier for archiving services to locate, harvest, update, and describe digital
          publications. Long-term preservation of digital publications ensures that they may continue to be accessible
          beyond the tenure of individual authors, file formats, publishers, or publishing platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fundamental use cases and requirements already help aid our archiving requirements (<i>e.g.,</i>
          <a class="req-ref-full" href="#r_const-res"></a>). However, archiving raises additional requirements:
        </p>

        <p id="r_archmetadata" class="req-set">
          There should be a way to indicate whether one or more Packaged Web Publication components contain (embedded)
          descriptive metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
          An archiving service needs a reliable way to determine which, if any, Web Publication components contain
          descriptive metadata, such as those described in <a href="#manifest-metadata">metadata and resources</a>.
          Without such a mechanism, the archiving service will have to develop and maintain publisher- and/or
          platform-specific heuristics for locating or parsing out descriptive metadata, making archiving more
          expensive and decreasing the reliability of reporting.
        </p>
        <ul class="use-cases">
          <li id="uc_archmetadata_harvesting">
            An archiving service sets out to conduct an initial harvest of an article. Along with the images, markup,
            scripts, and style and layout instructions that constitute the object, it is able to locate a file
            containing descriptive metadata. The archiving service retrieves these resources and packages them into a
            logical archival unit for ingestion into a preservation repository. A related process identifies and parses
            the descriptive metadata and saves its contents into an associated management database.

            An archiving service regularly polls for changes to an article that it has already archived. One such poll

            repository.

            service regularly polls for changes to this article, which it has already archived, and discovers the
            retraction. The archiving service retrieves the new resources and records those that are no longer
            accessible, carrying over the cumulative updates to a preservation repository.

          possibly sensitive, data. However, since a publication may use <a href="#r_owp">any part of the OWP</a>, it
          may choose to use functionality such as the ability to track a user's activity within the publication.
