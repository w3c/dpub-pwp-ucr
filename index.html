        A Portable Web Publication is a collection of content items (e.g.,
        pages, chapters, modules, articles) whose content is compatible with
        Web usage, and structured as a single, self-contained logical unit.
        This document describes the use cases that inform the requirements
        for a Portable Web Publication, and should be read as part of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pwp/">Portable Web Publications for
        the Open Web Platform</a>.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>The printed book has had hundreds of years of design refinement: we have developed and optimized page and book sizes and orientation, typesetting conventions, optimal margins and page layout. Readers in turn have grown used to the powerful affordances built into this information delivery technology: how we read books, use them, shelve them, own them, share them, and archive them.</p>

        <p>In parallel, the Web has developed with its own set of design principles and user-expectations: for ubiquity and speed of access and discovery, for the ease of linking information from one source to another, and for the simplicity of publishing anything, quickly.</p>

        <p>This Portable Web Publications Use Cases document is an effort by the W3C and the Digital Publishing Interest Group to articulate how these two design traditions work together to produce something more powerful, a fully accessible format which marries the bounded coherence of the printed book, with the open, networked spirit of the Web that can be used seamlessly online and offline.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Authors’ and readers’ requirements</h2>
                <section>
                    <h3>The publication should be readable in a browser</h3>
                    <p>Reading long form publications should not be restricted
                      to specific devices or applications but should be equally
                      available in a browser.</p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>Bob has some very specific plugins in his browser
                          that he enjoys using for, e.g., annotation using his
                          own annotation server, or quickly copy and publish
                          extracts in a specialized social service. That means
                          that he wants to be able to read his textbook in this
                          environment, enjoying the environment he is familiar
                          with, rather than being forced in to a special
                          application for the purpose of that specific
                          publication</li>

                        <li>Alice reads a scholarly paper that refers to large
                          datasets. The data can be presented interactively
                          through some very specialized data visualization
                          services relying on custom hardware on her computer.
                          These visualization services are incorporated into her
                          browser and can be used from within a web page. Alice
                          wants to make use of these wile reading her paper to
                          gain a better understanding of the content.</li>

                    <h3>The publication should conform to all the requirements of horizontal dependencies</h3>

                    <p>Web content has to be consumed under different circumstances: it must be available to the largest possible audience in a secure manner, providing the necessary protection of the reader’s privacy. Publication content must be able to answer to a number of principles like accessibility, internationalization, device independence, security, or privacy. (These are usually referred to, in the W3C context, as “horizontal” dependencies.) These principles are, in general terms:
                    </p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>(Web) Accessibility:</dt>
                        <dd>People with disabilities should be able to access the content, i.e., they should be able to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it, as well as contribute to it. Accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the content, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.</dd>
                        <dt>Internationalization:</dt>
                        <dd>Publications should be well adapted to any language, writing systems, region, or culture. This includes the usage, when appropriate, of left-to-right, right-to-left, horizontal or vertical writing; item numbering, or interactive forms specific to local cultures; usage of the right character sets and of local typographic conventions.</dd>
                        <dt>Device Independence:</dt>
                        <dd>Content should be usable on a large number of devices with very different device characteristics: different screen types and sizes, various input modalities, varying level of processing power, etc. These different affordances should be automatic with no, or very little user intervention.</dd>
                        <dt>Security:</dt>
                        <dd>Publications should prevent malicious attacks, data theft, etc., even if they contain secure mashups, access to distributed services, etc. Consuming the content should not jeopardize the integrity of the underlying data, users’ privacy, or machine operations.</dd>
                        <dt>Privacy:</dt>
                        <dd>Content should maintain and support the user’s privacy, in spite of the fact that the evolution of online technologies has increased the possibility for the collection and processing of personal, and possibly sensitive, data, as well as the ability to ubiquitously track the users' online activity.</dd>
                    </dl>

                    <p>These principles correspond to technical requirements on the underlying technologies (i.e., OWP, and its possible extension for PWP) insofar as the technologies <em>must empower the authors</em> (writers, editors, publishers, etc.) to produce content that follow them. Whether authors use the possibilities of these technologies or not is not addressed in this document.</p>

                    <p>All these constraints are usually formalized in the context of the usage on the Web, but they are also valid for publications in general <em>regardless of whether they are online or offline, or whether the publication is distributed as a single unit or not</em>. Actually, in some cases, for example due to legislative reasons, the demands on digital publications may be more stringent than for generic Web sites. The use cases below provide some examples for the publication-specific situations.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>Asmait uses a dedicated braille e-reader capable of using standard Open Web technologies, that can render any WCAG-compliant content. She needs to be able to read her newspaper on her dedicated braille reader, not just a standard browser and computer combination.</li>

                        <li>Legal Publishing Ltd. publishes all the official texts, as issued by the government of its country. Per local legislation, the publication MUST be accessible, following W3C’s WCAG Level AA requirements, to serve as official references in courts.</li>

                        <li>EducationPublishing Ltd. publishes digital textbooks to cover BigUniversity’s curriculae. These (digital) educational publications also include access to interactive tests via specialized services on the Web that regularly access the student’s progress. The privacy and the integrity of the student’s test data must be preserved (whether they are embedded in the publication or online). This, and the fact that digital textbooks must also abide to WCAG Level AA requirement in terms of accessibility, are such that EducationPublishing is liable in case they are not fulfilled.</li>

                        <li>PublicationInternational SA. publishes literary work all over the world and in many languages. In order to continue its business in, e.g., Japan, it must be able to produce digital publications with right-to-left and vertical writing, and following the Japanese typesetting traditions, because that is the only way those publications are accepted by local customers.</li>

                        <li>Vera has several devices she uses to read her books, depending on where she is. She may use her table with a larger screen when sitting in an armchair at home, she uses her phone when commuting to her work by train, and uses her laptop when adding more complex annotations to the book. The book is authored in a way that, while maintaing the integrity of data like bookmarks and annotations, the book is automatically adapted to a different screen size, or to the fact that her phone does not have a keyboard.</li>

                        <li>BigAirline uses digital versions of the airline manuals. This means that the manuals are put “online” to keep them up-to-date, and the pilots have access to the latest version even when they are flying, i.e., they are off line. The way the manuals are authors and managed ensures that the integrity of the manuals and the relevant data is maintained at all times, to secure that the pilots operate based on correct information only.</li>

                    <h3>PWPs should be able to make use of all facilities
                      offered by the Open Web Platform</h3>

                    <p>There is a formidable development of visualization systems,
                      interactive tools, and other powerful facilities that are
                      built on top of the Open Web Platform, including accessing
                      external services like Wolfram Alfa. These tools have
                      been traditionally developed for browsers, and provide
                      possibilities that traditional publications (books,
                      magazines, scholarly papers, educational materials, etc.)
                      should also benefit from. That requires publications to
                      become first class citizens on the Web platforms. </p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">
                        <li>For scholarly publishing, Web-only publications
                          gradually become part of the mainstream (e.g., the
                          multidisciplinary
                          <a href="http://www.plosone.org">PLOS ONE</a> or the
                          new
                          <a href="https://peerj.com/computer-science/">PeerJ
                            CompSci</a> journals) with the main content being
                            published using traditional Web technologies like
                            HTML and CSS. These publications increasingly use
                            additional media such as video, audio, animated
                            graphics, or very large images, and the trend is
                            to consider these as integral parts of the
                            scientific output. (
                            <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/">Mike
                              Bostock’s recent article on visualizing
                              algorithms</a> or the “live” presentation of data
                              in a <a href="http://f1000research.com/articles/3-176/v2">
                                paper published by F1000 Research</a> are good
                                examples for the new possibilities.) This means
                                the publications need access to the latest
                                visualization, data management, etc, tools that
                                the Open Web Platform based tools can offer.</li>

                        <li>Educational materials are increasingly making use
                          of Open Web Platform facilities. They include
                          runnable program snippets, interactive testing tools
                          (linked to online evaluation facilities); in many
                          respect, the borderline between these publications
                          and Web Applications is becoming fuzzy.</li>

                        <li id="in_house_doc">A special form of document are
                          “in-house” documents, whose production is related to
                          technical and/or user documentation of complex
                          products as well as complex administrative documents.
                          The sheer quantity and complexity of production, as
                          well as confidentiality requirements, mean that the
                          production are done in-house. In many respects major
                          corporations such as IBM, Intel, Renault, or Boeing,
                          or institutions like the European Commission, the FAO,
                          or the UNESCO have become specialized publishers
                          themselves. The quantity of documentation makes it
                          infeasible to produce these documents in print (or
                          print-only); instead, publishing them on the public
                          Web, an Intranet, and/or providing them through
                          specialized mobile devices is the viable alternative.
                          The production of these documents has similar
                          challenges to scholarly publications like
                          accessibility issues, portability of annotations, or
                          the possible inclusion of complex media.</li>

                    <p>Whereas a “scrolling” view is the dominating approach on
                      the Web in Web browsers, publications must provide the
                      possibility to switch to a paginated view if the user so
                      desires or as the author suggests. Pagination may
                      automatically adapt page sizes to the device’s or the
                      browser’s viewport, and may contain separate headers,

                          on their portable device in their home countries would

                          beneficial when done from the work floor (e.g., at an

                    <p>A Portable Web Publications would, usually, consists of
                      a (possibly large) number of Web Resources, like HTML,
                      SVG, or CSS, and it may also contain data files, or
                      executable resources like JavaScript, iPython scripts, or
                      Java. This reflects the current practice on the Web,
                      emphasizing the need of memory requirement on small
                      devices, cacheability, or independent development.</p>

                    <ul class="use-cases">

                          HTML contents formatted by, possibly, different CSS
                          files. The publisher needs the collection of all the
                          resources as a unit to include it into its business
                          workflow. </li>

                          HTML file. Parsing through one 1200-page HTML document
                          is difficult and resource-intensive. Parsing through a
                          package of 60 HTML documents, roughly 20 pages each,
                          is less resource-intensive.</li>

                  <h3>Find the (default) reading order of the resources of a PWP easily</h3>

                  <p>A user agent needs to know the sequence in which to present
                    components of a PWP to the user. A PWP will likely be
                    composed of multiple web documents. A typical simple PWP will
                    anywhere from 1 to 15 HTML documents and several image files,
                    in one location or many. A more complicated PWP may have many
                    more components, meaning that extracting the exact order from
                    within the resources (i.e., parsing them in advance to extract
                    the information) may be prohibitive. It is therefore necessary
                    for the reading system to have an easy access to the reading
                    order constituent resources. In particular, the user agent should also have the information on what the starting point of the publication rendering is.
                  </p>

                  <ul class="use-cases">
                      <li>Moby Dick contains 136 chapters. Each chapter is a
                        separate HTML document. The user agent must present the
                        chapters sequentially, starting by the first chapter.</li>
                      <li>The Encyclopedia of Stuff includes 1348 articles, each
                        one in a unique HTML document. The user agent must
                        present the articles in order (alphabetically, by title).

                  <p>A unique identification of a specific publication,
                    regardless of whether it is online or offline, or whether it
                    is part of a web site or a single (packaged) file is
                    essential. This unique identification should be mapped onto
                    the “real” location of the publication smoothly, without the
                    author’s interaction.
                  </p>

                  <ul class="use-cases">
                      <li>Digital publications make use of interactive cross
                        references within the publication (references to indeces,
                        images, etc). These references should be done once by
                        the author and should work regardless of whether the
                        publication is online or offline, for example.
                      </li>

                      <li>Scholarly references demand a unique identification
                        of the publication and, possibly, it internal structure.
                        That unique identification must be available as a Web link,
                        to make it possible for other publications and other
                        sites (e.g., the authors’ institutional sites) to
                        unambigously link to the publication. These features
                        are essential in the scholarly community to make, for
                        example, the assessment of individual researchers

  <h1>Changing State</h1>
<section>
  <h2>State Changing Document</h2>
    <p>Many publications - especially long form fiction and non-fiction - that
     users engage with for many hours. During this time, the user may shift
     states in many ways - starting consumption on an internet enabled PC,
     moving to an internet enabled portable device, going into offline-mode
     on that device, and then back to the PC.</p>

    <ul class="use-cases">

      <li>The user needs to ensure they have
    access to critical pieces of data while secondary assets have a pre-
    defined fallback that will allow the user to continue (for example, a
    poster image of a video that serves as a placeholder for an externally
    streamed video when internet is available).</li>

      <li>Nick is reading
    long-form narrative non-fiction. A publication filled with text, images,
    sounds, and multi-media files. Nick is also a multi-device user who
    wishes to consume the publication on multiple devices. Some of those
    devices have limited storage, and some of them have limited connectivity.
    Nick also rides the subway - where he loses internet connection, without
    warning - for long stretches of time.</li>

 <li>During offline or low-storage situations, there are still critical parts
     of the publication that are consumable - mainly the text (and possibly
     images). Having a reasonable fallback for video (a poster image or
     placeholder image) would allow Nick to read the content while offline or
     in limited storage. While this should be the job of the reading system,
     having a method in the publication for the author of the publication to
     mark what items are critical, and what need a fallback for limited
     connectivity/storage situations would greatly help the reading system and
     give more control to the publisher to ensure consistent experience with
     consuming the publication.</li>

   <li>Nick may know he's going to be in a no-connectivity situation and may
     want to obtain and locally store the entire (even non-critical) contents.
     This would be up to the reading system to provide a mechanism, but having
     a way to denote critical and fallback assets ensures that an entire
     package isn't downloaded when not necessary.</li>

   <li>For the case of scripting - it's possible that certain items will be
     dynamic - and will hit an external resource (or server) to generate
     on-the-fly data. In offline mode, the user would want to be alerted that
     content could not be obtained, or be shown some fallback set of data. In t
     his case, being able to specify a "no-connectivity" or "offline-mode"
     alternative for scripts would allow the publication author to have more
     control over the user's experience and replace a potential error-display
     with a limited subset of a good experience.</li>

  <h1>Sharing, Distribution, and External Resources</h1>

<section>
 <h2>Distribution</h2>
    <p>Multiple distribution points and reader devices for a PWP should not result in
      multiple versions of a PWP.</p>
  <ul class="use-cases">
    <li>Publisher Corp. Inc. publishes a new PWP, and sends this PWP to ACME
    its customers. This PWP is downloaded to devices, or synced across
    several devices, or made available to a customer-specific cloud.
    Customers can access this file from different retailers, through different
    applications, either directly or downloaded from private cloud. Thus, the
    PWP is duplicated many, many, many, many, many times, resulting in a huge
    number of items. There is one source manifestation, one ISBN identifier,
    and lots of items spread across devices and buyers.</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Retail (???)</h2>
     <p></p>
  <ul class="use-cases">
     <li>(e)books that are sold need to be delivered, so that purchasers can load
    them on offline devices.</li>

     <li>Purchased content has different expectations - one being that you have
    “something” or a reasonable use of that content in a logical way (such as
    always being able to read your amazon purchases through the amazon app)</li>

     <li>Sales Auditing -> Ability to track “what” is sold so that it can be paid.
    If all content is just free and different chunks are purchased, chasing
    rights/payments is an issue.  Basically the package can have an ISBN
    associated so that it can be tracked for sale - even multiple versions.</li>

  <h2>PWPs with Shared Resources</h2>
  <p>Several PWPs may share identical resources.</p>
  <ul class="use-cases">
    <li>EsteemedPublisher creates apps to distribute several journals to readers.
    These apps share script libraries, CSS files, and other resources.
    Distributing many journals as a package should enable systems to call the
    shared resources once, speeding up processing and enabling offline reading.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Cross-references</h2>
  <p>A user should have an option to pull their local copy of a PWP when
  there is a choice between a local, annotated copy and third-party source.</p>
  <ul class="use-cases">
   <li>Writer Annie writes a dissertation. She references to her Master's
    thesis, published on the university website. Her colleague Bob has
    read her Master's thesis before. When he clicks the reference in
    Annie's dissertation, he gets redirected to his local copy of Annie's
    Master's thesis. Her friend, Charlie, hasn't read her Master's thesis
    before. Charlie needs to be online when clicking the reference, to read
    Annie's Master's thesis. </li>

    data in CSV format. She and EsteemedJournal wish to provide users access
    to the CSVs when they gain access to her article. EsteemedJournal
    recommends that the package is built in such a way that a system can query
    the manifest to assess whether it is situationally appropriate to offer

    <h1>Manifests</h1>

    <p>In this document by <em>manifest</em> we mean an abstract place, typically one or several files, that contain information necessary to the proper management, rendering, etc, of the publication. This is opposed to <em>metadata</em> that contain information on the <em>content</em> of the publication like author, publication date, etc.</p>

    <p>Some fundamental use cases and requirements already imply the usage of manifests, e.g.:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#find-information"></a></li>
        <li><a href="#reading-order"></a></li>
    </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Manifests should include the basic characteristics of the constituent resources</h2>

      <p>A user agent requires information about the package and its components in order to process it. E.g., performance and memory requirements may prevent a user agent from parsing a large number of content documents in order to discover the necessary components and their relationships. A user agent may need to make some decisions about how to present content before displaying it.</p>

      <p>Some necessary features are listed among the fundamental features of a PWP (see <a href="#find-information"></a>); the use cases below provide a (non-exhaustive) list of further information.</p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>A user agent may not be able to process files beyond a certain size due to bandwidth, storage or memory limitations, or processing time expectations. Hence this information should be available in advance.</li>

        <li>A user agent should be able to process permissions and rights information for each component identified in the package. For example, it need to know whether it has the rights to place an image of the Mona Lisa owned by the Louvre in a package to be downloaded offline.</li>

        <li>For further processing the user agent needs to have access to a number of additional information like:
            <ul>
                <li>the accessibility of each component;</li>
                <li>whether it needs additional processing instructions, such as with MathML;</li>
                <li>the title, author(s), cover image, etc., to display the publication on a shelf without downloading all its content;</li>
                <li>whether the content is unaltered;</li>
                <li>the origin of the publication.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The manifest should provide access to the general metadata of a publication</h2>
        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>The manifest may be a "first point of entry" for the user agent when getting hold of a publication, and should therefore provide an easy way to get hold of the general publication metadata (e.g., author’s and publisher’s data, library data, copyright information, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Manifest should make it possible to provide a streamlined access to disjoint parts of the publication</h2>

      <p>It should be possible for the author to convey several reading orders for the content of the publication, that may go beyond the “default” <a href="reading-order">reading order</a>. Furthermore, this alternative reading order may not necessary include the full content of the publication but only specific parts thereof.</p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
          <li>EsteemedJournalPublisher would like to offer the users of the EsteemedJournal of Chemistry App the opportunity to read only the abstracts of the journals in the app. The App Package must offer the user a list (table of contents) of abstracts (disjoint objects in the package with semantic information or metadata informing the package of the nature of the object). </li>

          <li>The publisher wants to provide “teasers” for a book by providing a series of extracts that are meant to give an overview of the book without the necessity to read the whole publication. This can be typically used by a reseller allowing for a prospective client to access part of the publication free of charge.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Manifest should include information of new content</h2>

      <p>The manifest should include information that makes it possible for a user agent to find out whether a specific content has changed since a last access or not. This may or may not directly reflect versioning, as referred to in the requirement on versioning (see <a href="#versioning"></a>), insofar as the granularity may be different.</p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
          <li>Shoshana is an organic chemist. She has purchased the Esteemed Journal of Chemistry App. She downloads Organic Chem Quarterly in her lab and reads the first article over lunch. Shoshana begins the book reviews during office hours but must tend to her students' questions, so she closes the app. Shoshana opens the app on the train ride home to resume reading the book reviews. She is happy to find that the app opens to the exact location and opens quickly because most of the material does not need to be downloaded a second time. </li>

          <li>An archival service needs to update an Archival Information Package (i.e., a previously harvested PWP) because a new version of a component of the PWP has been published</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Manifest should include means to use links to resources, regardless of location</h2>

      <p>The fundamental requirement on identification already states that there should be a way to uniquely identify a publication (see <a href="#unique-identifier"></a>). This requirement should be extended to resources <em>within</em> a publication, e.g., a chapter, an image, a mathematical formula. To achieve these, the manifest should contain the necessary information to make the mapping of URI-s possible.</p>

      <ul class="use-cases">
          <li>A scholarly mathematical publication refers to a specific theorem in another publication, and that reference must be unique, stable and retrievable on the Web. That reference should not depend on whether the publishes issues a new version of the target publication (thereby possibly change the section numbering) or whether the publication is available now for offline use.</li>

          <li>An archival service wants to harvest (spider) a PWP, and expects to find in the manifest what it will need to make sure it gets all the pieces of the PWP that need to be archived, even if on separate servers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="alternative-reading-order">
        <h2>Manifest may include alternative reading orders</h2>

        <p>Whilst one of the fundamental requirements is that the default reading order should be made available to the user agent (see <a href="#reading-order"></a>), the manifest should also provide means to define alternative reading orders. It is up to the user agent how this alternative reading order is conveyed to the reader (via some suitable user interface techniques).</p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>EducationalPublisher publishes a complex textbook. The textbook is created is such a way that it could be used both for beginner and advanced level. The default reading order corresponds to beginners, but the goal is that advanced students can follow a different path through the material, corresponding to their level of knowledge. EducationPublisher adds, therefore, alternative reading orders to the publication that advanced users can follow</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="flexible-access-manifest">
        <h2>There should be flexible ways to get hold of the manifest for a publication</h2>

        <p>The physical realization of the manifest may be a file in some predefined format (XML, JSON, etc.). There may be several ways to get hold of that manifest (file on a well known location, usage of an HTML <code>link</code> element, etc). PWP should provide a high level of flexibility, i.e., possible alternatives, on how that manifest should be found.
        </p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li id="bigretailer-manifest">BigRetailer receives a publication from EsteemedPublisher that it intends to add to its catalogue. BigRetailer wants to change or extend some general information (typically contained in the manifest) regarding the publication, like the local bibliographic metadata, or its own “teaser” in terms an alternative reading order (see <a href="#alternative-reading-order"></a>). To achieve that, BigRetailer provides its own version of the publication manifest, and makes it sure that the user agent takes that one as the publication’s manifest (e.g., by providing a reference to the alternative manifest via an HTTP <code>LINK</code> header).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>There should be a possibility to combine manifests from several origins</h2>

        <p>The default approach for a user agent is to get hold of the manifest (file) as one unit via some flexible means (see <a href="#flexible-access-manifest"></a>). However, an even more flexible means is to provide possibilities to provide <em>several</em> manifests file that the user agen would combine, following some rules, to yield the final, overall manifest for the publication.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            It is recognized that the proper definition/implementation of this requirement may lead to major technical complications and, therefore may not be fulfilled.
        </p>

        <ul class="use-cases">
            <li>The simple solution for the <a href="#bigretailer-manifest">use case involving BigRetailer</a> requires the creation of a <em>complete</em> manifest, involving duplicating the information provided the EsteemedPublisher. This is obviously error prone if the publication’s manifest is large. If it was possible to combine manifests, BitRetailer can only provide its own additional (and possibly replacement) information and let the user agent combine the manifests of BigRetailer and of EsteemedPublisher to yield the final manifest.</li>

    <h2>The locations of all PWP components should be discoverable</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn where all of the components that constitute a PWP are located in order to be able to archive it.

    <h2>There should be a way to discover that one or more new components have been added to a PWP</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn that one or more PWP components have been added to a PWP in order to be able to archive them. Without such a mechanism, there is a possibility that the archiving service will not know that the new component belongs to the PWP, because the publisher- and/or platform-specific heuristics have not been updated.</p>

    <h2>There should be a way to discover that one or more PWP components have been removed from a PWP</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to learn that one or more PWP components have been removed from a PWP in order to be able to propagate this change to the archive. Without such a mechanism, there is a possibility that the archiving service will mistakenly make PWP components accessible that should not be.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>A publisher issues a retraction for a published article, resulting in the addition of new Resources to the object (i.e., the retraction notice) and the removal of others (i.e., the article content). An archiving service regularly polls for changes to this article, which it has already archived, and discovers the retraction. The archiving service retrieves the new Resources and record those that are no longer accessible, carrying over the cumulative updates to a preservation repository.</li>
      <li>A copyright dispute results in the takedown of a published book. An archiving service regularly polls for changes to this book, which it has already archived, and discovers that it has been taken down. It records that the Resources that constitute the object are no longer accessible and propagates this update to a preservation repository.</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2>There should be a way to indicate whether one or more PWP components contain structured descriptive metadata</h2>
    <p>An archiving service needs a reliable way to determine which, if any, PWP components contain structured descriptive metadata. Without such a mechanism, the archiving service will have to develop and maintain publisher- and/or platform-specific heuristics for locating or parsing out descriptive metadata, making archiving more expensive and decreasing the reliability of reporting.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>An archiving service sets out to conduct an initial harvest of an article. Along with the images, markup, scripts, and style and layout instructions that constitute the object, it is able to locate a file containing descriptive metadata. The archiving service retrieves these resources and packages them into a logical archival unit for ingest into a preservation repository. A related process identifies and parses the descriptive metadata structure and saves its contents into an associated management database.</li>

  <h1>Accessibility</h1>

    <p>A fundamental use case and requirement already imply the usage of accessibility, e.g.:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#personalized"></a></li>
    </ul>

    <section>
    <h2>Accessible Metadata</h2>
    <p> Accessibility of a PWP as a whole must be discoverable so that users know how (or whether) a PWP is accessible</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li> Accessibility of a PWP must be discoverable so that users know how (or whether) a PWP is accessible</li>
        <li>Ferdous wants to buy a book about a museum exhibit and wants to make sure that his screen reader will describe the images to him in great detail.</li>
        <li>Alejandra must ensure that the videos in her textbook have captioning before she purchases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Granular Accessibility of a PWP must be discoverable so that users know how (or whether) a specific chapter or element within a PWP is accessible</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
      <li>Jessie is taking a class and the professor has assigned Chapter 5 in an art textbook for review, but before Jessie puchases the book she wants to ensure that Chapter 5 is accessible.</li>
    </ul>
   </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Adding Alternative Media</h2>
    <p>A PWP must support the ability to include multiple renditions of a publication.  Within their publication in additon to the print rendition a publisher may include a fully narrated rendition, or a video with described audio and captioning.</p>
    <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>As a publisher of accessible content, I need to add content such as a braille style sheet, image descriptions, or video captioning (text / descriptive audio) to a PWP previously published by a third party.</li>
        <li>Frank has dyslexia and finds reading printed books a very frustrating experience.  Having a book read to him with synchronized highlighting of the text not only allows him to comprehend the book but helps him become a better reader.</li>
        <li>Julia has ADHD and is frequently be distracted when trying to read. Her teachers' determined she is a visual learner and scores better when the material is presented in video format. </li>
        <li>Jacob has poor depth perception and is more of a tactile learner, he has a difficult time conceptualizing three dimensional objects.  Having an embedded 3D image available to be printed alongside the visual image will greatly improve his understanding of the object being presented.</li>
    </ul>
   </section>

    <section>
     <h2>Braille</h2>
       <p>There is an important difference between just sending the raw text to a braille display which will translate the text to the default braille grade and language the braille display is using and having a pre-formatted braille rendition using a specific braille table.</p>
     <ul class="use-cases">
        <li>As a publisher wanting to fulfill my legal requirements in creating an accessible Math textbook, to this end the inclusion of math equation examples in both Braille as well as MathML is desired since not all reading systems fully support MathML.  Nemeth Braille is primarily used and has therefore been added as a separate preformatted Nemeth Braille examples to my publication in addition to the MathML.</li>

         <li>Alberto who has been blind since birth is studying to become an engineer.  Some of his advance textbooks would greatly benefit from a pre-formatted fully transcribed braille rendition with braille codes or complex formatting which is not yet well supported by the software typically available.</li>

         <li>James a struggling blind artist requires that the musical score within this publication be rendered in braille music.  James uses freely available assistive technology which does not have braille music translations built in and would need this already converted into braille music notation.</li>

     <h2>Building a Custom PWP</h2>
       <p>TBD</p>

   <section>
       <h2>Package needs to support time-based media and text </h2>
         <p>A PWP needs to support time-based media, such as synchronized
           video, audio, captions or transcript, or sign language interpretation.
           A PWP must enable synced media experience to the user
           while navigating through the book with sufficient level
           of granularity without constant connectivity.</p>

       <ul class="use-cases">
           <li>Illyés has a cognitive disability and uses accomodated texts in
             the classroom, to help her learn the content while improving her reading.
             Her assistive technology uses combined audio and text, turning the page
             for her while reading along in sync with the page currently open.</li>
          <li>Bogi has auditory processing disorder. They are reading an annotated screenplay showing
            the author's original notes, along with synchronized video clips.
            Bogi needs to be able to view the captions on the video clips, even
            though they're associated with snippets of the screenplay.</li>
